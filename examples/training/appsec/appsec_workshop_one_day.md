# FIASSE Workshop: Developer-First Security for Application Security Engineers  

## One-Day Training for AppSec Professionals

### Workshop Overview

This workshop is designed for Application Security Engineers who want to move beyond "shovel left" security and become effective partners in the software development lifecycle. The focus is on understanding how software is built, integrating security into requirements, and driving a cultural shift toward developer-first security using the FIASSE framework.

### Target Audience

- Application Security Engineers
- Security analysts and consultants
- Security champions and AppSec team leads

### Workshop Schedule

#### Part 1: Understanding Modern Software Development (9:00 AM – 10:30 AM)

**Learning Objectives:**

- Grasp the basics of modern software development workflows (Agile, CI/CD, code review, etc.)
- Understand the developer’s perspective and daily realities
- Recognize why "shovel left" security fails in practice

**Topics:**

- Overview of the software development lifecycle (SDLC)
- Agile, DevOps, and product team structures
- Developer priorities: value delivery, maintainability, and velocity
- The pitfalls of "shovel left" security and why it creates friction

**Activities:**

- Mapping your current security interventions to the SDLC
- Group discussion: Where does security create friction in your organization?

**Break (10:30 AM – 10:45 AM)**

#### Part 2: Integrating Security into Requirements and Planning (10:45 AM – 12:15 PM)

**Learning Objectives:**

- Learn how to participate in requirements gathering and planning sessions
- Understand how to translate security goals into actionable requirements
- Practice communicating security in developer-friendly language

**Topics:**

- The FIASSE approach: Security as an integrated quality, not a bolt-on
- Participating in product planning and backlog refinement
- Writing security requirements and acceptance criteria
- Using SSEM attributes to frame security in engineering terms

**Activities:**

- Hands-on: Drafting security requirements for a sample feature
- Role-play: Security engineer in a product planning meeting

**Lunch (12:15 PM – 1:15 PM)**

---

#### Part 3: Fostering a Developer-First Security Culture (1:15 PM – 3:15 PM)

**Learning Objectives:**

- Build trust and credibility with development teams
- Encourage security ownership among developers
- Shift from vulnerability reporting to enabling secure design and coding

**Topics:**

- The developer-first security mindset: guardrails not gates
- Coaching developers on security aspects of SSEM attributes (Maintainability, Trustworthiness, Reliability)
- Avoiding anti-patterns: How to stop "shoveling left" and start collaborating

**Activities:**

- Group exercise: Transforming a vulnerability report into a developer-friendly improvement suggestion
- Discussion: Success stories and challenges in building security culture

**Break (3:15 PM – 3:30 PM)**

---

#### Part 4: Assurance, xAST, and Continuous Improvement (3:30 PM – 4:45 PM)

**Learning Objectives:**

- Understand the role of xAST (SAST, DAST, IAST, etc.) in a FIASSE environment
- Learn how to use assurance activities to validate requirements, not just find bugs
- See how security tooling fits into a developer-first, FIASSE-aligned workflow

**Topics:**

- Strategic xAST: Assurance, not policing
- Using xAST results to inform requirements and design, not just mitigation
- Conformance to the development flaw lifecycle
- Continuous improvement: Feedback loops between security, development, and product

**Activities:**

- Case study: Turning xAST findings into actionable requirements
- Q&A: Integrating assurance activities without disrupting development

---

#### Workshop Wrap-up and Next Steps (4:45 PM – 5:00 PM)

- Summary of key takeaways
- Resources for continued learning
- Question and answer session
- Workshop evaluation

---

### Materials and Resources

- Workshop slides and handouts
- Example security requirements and acceptance criteria
- SSEM attributes reference guide
- Templates for security participation in planning and backlog refinement
- Communication tips for AppSec in developer environments

---

This workshop is designed to help Application Security Engineers become valued partners in the development process, shifting from "shovel left" security to a collaborative, developer-first approach that is central to FIASSE.
