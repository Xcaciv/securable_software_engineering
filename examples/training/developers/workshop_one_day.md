# FIASSE Workshop: Engineering Securable Software  

## One-Day Workshop for Developers

### Workshop Overview

This one-day intensive workshop introduces developers to the Framework for Integrating Application Security into Software Engineering (FIASSE) and its core component, the Securable Software Engineering Model (SSEM). Designed for software engineers, this workshop provides practical guidance on building inherently securable software by enhancing your existing engineering practices. Think of FIASSE not as a bridge between separate domains, but as an emulsifier that naturally integrates security into your development process, enhancing security outcomes through sound engineering principles.

### Target Audience

- Software developers and engineers
- Technical leads and architects
- Quality assurance engineers
- Development teams looking to enhance their security posture

### Workshop Schedule

#### Part 1: Foundations of FIASSE (9:00 AM - 10:30 AM)

**Learning Objectives:**

- Understand the concept of "securable" software vs. traditional security approaches
- Recognize how FIASSE enhances existing engineering practices
- Grasp the role of security in development
- Learn the core principles underlying FIASSE for integrating security

**Topics:**

- The Application Security Challenge: Common friction points in security outcomes
- The Securable Paradigm: No Static Secure State
- Primary directive: Resiliently Add Computing Value
- Security Mission: Reducing Material Impact
- FIASSE as an integration agent: Naturally integrating security into engineering practices
- From Requirements to Assurance (and into operation): A natural engineering workflow

**Activities:**

- Group discussion: Security challenges in participants' current development practices
- Interactive exercise: Identifying securable vs. rigid security approaches in your codebase

**Break (10:30 AM - 10:45 AM)**

#### Part 2: The Securable Software Engineering Model (10:45 AM - 12:15 PM)

**Learning Objectives:**

- Identify and understand the core attributes of securable software
- Recognize how engineering principles directly enhance security outcomes
- Apply SSEM as a design language within your existing engineering vocabulary

**Topics:**

- Overview of SSEM structure and objectives
- Core Securable Attributes and their security implications:
  - Maintainability: Analyzability, Modifiability, Testability
  - Trustworthiness: Confidentiality, Accountability, Authenticity
  - Reliability: Availability, Integrity, Fault Tolerance, Resilience
- SSEM as a Design Language: Enhancing engineering communication
- Practical approaches to measuring SSEM attributes within your codebase

**Activities:**

- Code review exercise: Evaluating sample code against SSEM attributes
- Group activity: Identifying where your existing engineering best practices already enhance security

**Lunch (12:15 PM - 1:15 PM)**

#### Part 3: Practical Application of FIASSE (1:15 PM - 3:15 PM)

**Learning Objectives:**

- Apply FIASSE principles within your existing development workflow
- Connect security requirements to implementation and assurance
- Implement defensive/resilient coding practices that align with engineering excellence
- Manage dependencies effectively using SSEM principles

**Topics:**

- Requirements to Assurance: The complete security enhancement cycle
- Establishing clear security expectations through requirements
- Trust boundaries: Identifying and implementing appropriate controls
- Security assurance as validation of requirements
- Resilient coding practices that represent engineering excellence:
  - Input validation techniques
  - Output encoding strategies
  - Error handling best practices
- Dependency management through the FIASSE lens
- Security-enhanced code reviews as a natural part of engineering practice

**Activities:**

- Hands-on exercise: Writing security requirements and acceptance criteria
- Practical task: Applying defensive coding practices to vulnerable code samples
- Mini threat modeling exercise using the "Four Question Framework"
- Small group activity: Evaluating dependencies using SSEM attributes

**Break (3:15 PM - 3:30 PM)**

#### Part 4: Collaboration in Security Engineering (3:30 PM - 4:45 PM)

**Learning Objectives:**

- Understand how application security naturally fits within your engineering practice
- Identify common anti-patterns in security implementation
- Establish effective strategies for integrating security throughout development
- Understand the distinct but complementary skills of engineering and security specializations

**Topics:**

- The "Shoveling Left" phenomenon and how to avoid it
- Strategic use of security tooling and output
- Roles and responsibilities in an integrated development process
- Understanding specialized security skills and how they complement engineering
- Making security a natural aspect of engineering excellence

**Activities:**

- Role-play exercise: Collaborating on security requirements and implementation
- Discussion: Identifying and addressing "Shoveling Left" in your organization
- Q&A panel (if possible, with an AppSec professional)

#### Workshop Wrap-up and Next Steps (4:45 PM - 5:00 PM)

- Summary of key takeaways
- Resources for continued learning
- Question and answer session
- Workshop evaluation

### Materials and Resources

- Workshop slides and handouts
- Code examples demonstrating both vulnerable and securable implementations
- FIASSE reference guide with SSEM attributes checklist
- Recommended tools for measuring code qualities aligned with SSEM
- Templates for security requirements and acceptance criteria

### Follow-up Resources

- FIASSE-RFC document
- Recommended reading on secure software engineering
- Online community for ongoing questions and discussion
- Templates for security requirements and threat modeling

### Pre-Workshop Preparation

Participants should:

- Bring a laptop with their preferred development environment

This workshop is designed to be hands-on and practical, focusing on how developers can enhance their existing engineering expertise to build inherently securable software. The emphasis is on the natural integration of security principles into the development lifecycle through requirements, implementation, and assuranceâ€”where security becomes a natural outcome of engineering excellence rather than a separate concern.
