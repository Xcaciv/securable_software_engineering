# FIASSE/SSEM Aligned API Security Checklist (Functional Perspective)

This checklist integrates principles from FIASSE and the SSEM. It is organized by cross-cutting functional security areas. Within each area, checklist items are aligned with SSEM's core attributes (Maintainability, Trustworthiness, Reliability) and categorized by software engineering phase to help build 'securable' APIs.

**Preamble:** This checklist should be tailored based on the specific threats identified for your API during threat modeling exercises. Not all items will apply equally to all APIs. Prioritize checks based on the API's data sensitivity, exposure (internal vs. external), and the impact of a potential compromise.

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

*Focus: Verifying the identity of users/systems and ensuring they only access authorized resources and operations according to the principle of least privilege.*

### 1.1 Design & Architecture

- [ ] Document authentication/authorization flows using sequence diagrams and data flow diagrams; conduct peer review for understandability.
- [ ] Externalize authorization policy configurations (e.g., roles, permissions) to allow updates without code deployment.
- [ ] Ensure authentication and authorization logic is modular, with high cohesion and low coupling, to facilitate updates and reduce regression risk.
- [ ] Design auth components with clearly defined interfaces for automated testing; mock dependencies where necessary.
- [ ] Select and document specific, industry-recognized authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0 with PKCE, OpenID Connect). Justify any deviation.
- [ ] Avoid Basic Authentication. If legacy use is unavoidable, document risk acceptance and mitigation (e.g., only on TLS-protected internal networks).
- [ ] Design a fine-grained authorization model (e.g., Role-Based Access Control - RBAC, Attribute-Based Access Control - ABAC) based on the principle of least privilege; document roles and permissions explicitly.
- [ ] Define and document secure storage mechanisms for credentials, tokens, and API keys (e.g., use of approved vault technology, HSMs for critical keys).
- [ ] Design resource identifiers to be non-guessable/non-enumerable (e.g., UUIDs) where direct object references are used and could lead to enumeration attacks.
- [ ] Design auth systems for high availability and resilience (e.g., redundant instances, failover mechanisms for identity providers or policy decision points). Document high availability strategy.
- [ ] Define specific recovery objectives (RPO/RTO) for auth services.

### 1.2 Development & Implementation

- [ ] Implement auth using well-documented code, adhering to established coding standards, and leveraging approved standard libraries/framework features (specify which ones).
- [ ] Configuration for auth (e.g., token issuers, allowed algorithms, role definitions) is stored in version-controlled configuration files, not hardcoded.
- [ ] Implement chosen standard authentication protocols according to their latest security best practices (e.g., for OAuth 2.0, implement PKCE for public clients).
- [ ] Enforce password policies meeting [Specify Standard, e.g., NIST SP 800-63B] requirements (length, disallow common passwords).
- [ ] Implement MFA for all user accounts, especially for administrative or privileged access, using approved MFA factors.
- [ ] For JWTs:
  - [ ] Backend explicitly specifies and validates the `alg` header in received JWTs against an approved list (e.g., RS256, ES256), rejecting tokens with `none` or unexpected algorithms.
  - [ ] Use cryptographically strong, randomly generated secret keys (for symmetric) or key pairs (for asymmetric), unique per environment, managed via approved secret management solution.
  - [ ] Set token expiration times (e.g., `exp` claim) to the shortest practical duration based on use case (e.g., 15 minutes for access tokens, hours/days for refresh tokens).
  - [ ] Implement a token revocation mechanism (e.g., distributed blacklist, short-lived tokens with frequent re-authentication) if session invalidation is required before natural expiry.
- [ ] Implement and enforce the designed fine-grained authorization model consistently. Verify permissions on every request for the specific resource and action being attempted.
- [ ] When using OAuth, strictly validate the `redirect_uri` server-side against a pre-registered allowlist. Use and validate the `state` parameter to prevent CSRF.
- [ ] Do not rely on client-supplied parameters (e.g., user ID in URL, role in token claim without signature validation) for authorization decisions without rigorous server-side validation against the authenticated principal's session/token.
- [ ] Ensure all API endpoints are protected by authentication by default; explicitly declare and justify any anonymous endpoints.
- [ ] Implement auth mechanisms to fail securely (e.g., deny access by default if a policy decision point is unavailable, unless explicitly designed for cached decisions with clear risk assessment).

### 1.3 Testing & Validation

- [ ] Develop specific, automated test cases for each defined role and permission, covering positive/negative scenarios and attempts to bypass controls (e.g., IDOR, privilege escalation paths identified in threat models).
- [ ] Test auth configuration changes (e.g., adding a new role, modifying a permission) in a staging environment before production deployment.
- [ ] Ensure test environment allows for easy simulation of different user roles, permissions, and policy configurations.
- [ ] Conduct specific tests for authentication bypass (e.g., parameter tampering, token manipulation, replay attacks).
- [ ] Conduct specific tests for authorization bypass:
  - [ ] Horizontal privilege escalation (accessing data of other users at the same privilege level).
  - [ ] Vertical privilege escalation (gaining higher privileges than assigned).
  - [ ] Test for Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) by attempting to access resources not authorized for the current user.
- [ ] Verify secure handling of credentials and session tokens (e.g., not logged, not in GET requests, `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for cookies if used).
- [ ] Test JWT implementation for common vulnerabilities (e.g., `alg:none`, weak secrets, signature stripping, key confusion).
- [ ] Conduct load testing on auth systems to ensure performance under expected and peak load.
- [ ] Conduct specific failure injection tests (e.g., simulate IdP outage, database connection failure for policy store) to verify fail-secure behavior and high availability mechanisms.

### 1.4 Deployment, Operations & Maintenance

- [ ] Establish a documented schedule (e.g., quarterly, annually, post-major system change) and assign responsibility for reviewing and updating auth configurations and policies based on evolving threat intelligence and business requirements.
- [ ] Implement a documented process for updating or revoking credentials and permissions, including emergency revocation procedures.
- [ ] Establish and enforce a policy for regular rotation of sensitive keys and credentials (e.g., API keys, JWT signing keys) with specific rotation periods defined.
- [ ] Periodically (e.g., quarterly) review and audit access control policies (roles, permissions) against current job functions and the principle of least privilege. Document reviews.
- [ ] Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and error rates for authentication and authorization services (e.g., login success/failure rates, token validation latency, policy evaluation errors). Set up alerts for anomalies.

## 2. Data Security (Confidentiality, Integrity & Cryptography)

*Focus: Protecting data from unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss, both in transit and at rest, using appropriate cryptographic measures and handling practices.*

### 2.1 Design & Architecture

- [ ] Document data classification levels (e.g., public, internal, confidential, restricted) and map them to specific data elements handled by the API.
- [ ] Design data protection mechanisms (e.g., specific encryption libraries, KMS integration points) for clarity, using established design patterns, and ensure they are documented.
- [ ] Ensure cryptographic operations are implemented via a dedicated, well-abstracted module/service to facilitate updates or algorithm changes.
- [ ] Design cryptographic modules to be testable with known key values and vectors in isolated test environments.
- [ ] Mandate and document the use of specific TLS versions (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher, prefer TLS 1.3) and approved cipher suites for all data in transit.
- [ ] Define and document the specific encryption algorithms, modes, and key lengths to be used for sensitive data at rest, based on data classification.
- [ ] Design a secure key, secret, and certificate management strategy, including:
  - [ ] Use of an approved Key Management Service (KMS) or Hardware Security Module (HSM) for high-value keys.
  - [ ] Defined key generation, distribution, storage, rotation, and revocation procedures.
  - [ ] Minimal exposure of keys to applications and personnel.
- [ ] Identify all sensitive data elements (as per data classification) and design controls to prevent their unnecessary exposure in URLs, query parameters, logs, or error messages. Document these controls.
- [ ] Design key management systems (KMS, HSMs) for high availability and resilience, matching or exceeding the API's availability targets. Document high availability strategy for KMS.
- [ ] Assess and document the performance impact of cryptographic operations on API response times.

### 2.2 Development & Implementation

- [ ] Implement data protection measures using well-documented code, adhering to established coding standards, and using approved, standard, vetted cryptographic libraries (specify which ones, e.g., BouncyCastle, libsodium, JCA/JCE).
- [ ] Configuration for cryptographic operations (e.g., algorithm choices, key identifiers) is stored in version-controlled configuration files, not hardcoded.
- [ ] Enforce HTTPS with current TLS configurations (e.g., TLS 1.2+, strong cipher suites as per policy) for all API communication.
- [ ] Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header with an appropriate `max-age` and `includeSubDomains` if applicable. Consider preloading.
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest using approved strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256 GCM) and manage encryption keys securely via the defined KMS/HSM strategy.
- [ ] Avoid exposing sensitive data (as per data classification) in URLs or query parameters.
- [ ] Review all API responses to ensure no inadvertent exposure of sensitive data beyond what is explicitly required by the API contract for that user role.
- [ ] Implement masking, redaction, or tokenization for sensitive data in API responses and logs where the full data is not necessary for the specific context or user.
- [ ] Store API keys, secrets, and cryptographic keys in the approved secure storage solution (e.g., vault service). Avoid hardcoding secrets in code, configuration files, or deployment scripts.
- [ ] Implement and test automated key rotation for cryptographic keys and secrets according to defined policy (e.g., every 90 days for API keys, annually for signing keys).
- [ ] Ensure JWT secrets/keys are managed as per the secure key management strategy, are unique per environment, and are of sufficient complexity/entropy.
- [ ] Encode data in API responses using the `Content-Type` header (e.g., `application/json; charset=utf-8`). For HTML-like `Content-Type`s, apply context-aware output encoding to prevent XSS if responses might be rendered directly in a browser.
- [ ] Implement cryptographic operations efficiently to minimize performance impact, using hardware acceleration where available and appropriate.
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for cryptographic operations (e.g., key fetch failure, decryption error) to prevent denial of service or unexpected API behavior.

### 2.3 Testing & Validation

- [ ] Develop automated tests for encryption/decryption processes using known test vectors for chosen algorithms.
- [ ] Test key management integration points (e.g., fetching keys from KMS) for correct functionality and error handling.
- [ ] Verify that changes to cryptographic configurations (e.g., algorithm update) can be deployed and rolled back safely.
- [ ] Verify TLS configurations using tools like SSL Labs SSL Server Test; ensure no use of deprecated protocols (SSLv3, TLS 1.0/1.1) or weak ciphers. Check for HSTS header.
- [ ] Test for any leakage of sensitive data (as per data classification) in API responses, error messages, or logs, including via indirect channels (e.g., differing response times or error messages for existent vs. non-existent sensitive data).
- [ ] Validate secure key and secret management processes through procedural review and, where possible, technical testing (e.g., attempting unauthorized key access, verifying rotation).
- [ ] Test data integrity controls if implemented (e.g., HMACs, digital signatures on data).
- [ ] Conduct performance testing of API endpoints involving significant cryptographic operations to ensure they meet latency requirements under load.
- [ ] Test the reliability of cryptographic operations and key management systems under failure conditions (e.g., KMS temporarily unavailable).

### 2.4 Deployment, Operations & Maintenance

- [ ] Establish a documented schedule (e.g., annually, or when new vulnerabilities are published) for reviewing and updating cryptographic algorithms, libraries, and key management practices to adhere to current industry standards (e.g., NIST guidelines, OWASP recommendations).
- [ ] Ensure processes are in place for securely decommissioning old cryptographic keys and data encrypted with them, if applicable.
- [ ] Regularly (e.g., quarterly) review and rotate API keys, secrets, and cryptographic keys according to defined policy. Document rotation events.
- [ ] Monitor certificate expiry dates and automate renewal where possible.
- [ ] Periodically audit access to key management systems and sensitive data stores.
- [ ] Monitor the health, performance (e.g., latency of crypto ops, KMS availability), and error rates of key management systems and cryptographic services. Set up alerts for anomalies.

## 3. Input Validation & Processing Security

*Focus: Ensuring all incoming data is validated against strict criteria and processed securely to prevent injection flaws, data corruption, and other attacks stemming from untrusted input.*

### 3.1 Design & Architecture

    - [ ] Design input validation to use a shared library/module across API endpoints, with validation rules externalized to version-controlled configuration files (e.g., JSON Schema, OpenAPI spec extensions) for easy updates.
    - [ ] Mandate that all input validation rules (data types, formats, lengths, ranges, allowed characters/regex) for each field of every API endpoint are documented within the API specification (e.g., OpenAPI `pattern`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `enum`, `format` attributes).
    - [ ] For every API endpoint and every input parameter (headers, URL parameters, query parameters, request body fields): define and document strict validation rules for data type, format (e.g., using regex for strings, specific date formats), length (min/max), range (min/max for numbers), and allowed character sets/values (allow-list preferred). Specify maximum allowable sizes for request bodies and individual fields.
    - [ ] For each API endpoint, explicitly define and document the allowed HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Design endpoints to reject requests using disallowed methods with a `405 Method Not Allowed` status code.
    - [ ] Design API endpoints to validate the `Content-Type` header against an allow-list of expected media types (e.g., `application/json`). Plan to reject requests with unsupported `Content-Type` with a `415 Unsupported Media Type`. Similarly, plan to validate `Accept` headers and respond with `406 Not Acceptable` if the requested type cannot be served.
    - [ ] Design input processing logic to include robust error handling for exceptions arising from malformed or unexpected data. Define maximum acceptable sizes for inputs (e.g., request body, string lengths, array sizes) to prevent resource exhaustion.

### 3.2 Development & Implementation

    - [ ] Implement the shared input validation library/module, ensuring it's well-commented, especially for complex validation logic. Enforce its usage across all relevant API endpoints.
    - [ ] Implement server-side validation for ALL input parameters based on the defined rules. For invalid input, return a generic error message (e.g., "Invalid input") with an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., `400 Bad Request`, `422 Unprocessable Entity`) and log detailed error information (including specific validation failures) internally only.
    - [ ] Implement HTTP method validation on all endpoints, returning `405 Method Not Allowed` for inappropriate methods as per design.
    - [ ] Implement `Content-Type` and `Accept` header validation as per design, returning `415` or `406` status codes respectively for unsupported types.
    - [ ] To prevent injection flaws (SQLi, NoSQLi, OS Commandi, LDAPi, XSS, etc.):
      - [ ] Use parameterized queries or server-side prepared statements for all database interactions.
      - [ ] Utilize ORMs/ODMs with their built-in protections enabled and correctly configured; understand and avoid unsafe ORM/ODM patterns.
      - [ ] Implement context-aware output encoding (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, URL) for any user-supplied data reflected in API responses, especially if responses might be rendered in a browser.
      - [ ] Use input sanitization only as a secondary defense; document all sanitization logic and its specific purpose.
    - [ ] When parsing XML, configure the parser to disable DTD processing and external entity resolution to prevent XXE vulnerabilities.
    - [ ] When parsing XML, YAML, or other formats supporting complex object graphs or references (e.g., with anchors/aliases), configure parsers to limit entity expansion, document depth, number of elements/objects, and overall payload size to prevent resource exhaustion attacks (e.g., Billion Laughs, XML Bomb).
    - [ ] Implement input processing and validation logic such that failures for one request (e.g., due to malformed data) do not corrupt shared state, exhaust resources (e.g., connection pools, memory), or otherwise impact the processing of other valid requests.

### 3.3 Testing & Validation

    - [ ] Develop and maintain a suite of unit and integration tests for the input validation library and its application, covering valid inputs, common invalid inputs (e.g., wrong type, out of range), boundary values, and known malicious patterns (e.g., basic injection strings like `\' OR \'1\'=\'1\'`).
    - [ ] Conduct automated fuzz testing against all API endpoints using tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, custom scripts) that generate a wide range of malformed, oversized, and unexpected inputs, targeting common vulnerabilities. Document fuzzing test plans and results.
    - [ ] Perform targeted security testing (manual and automated using DAST tools) for specific injection vulnerabilities (SQLi, NoSQLi, OS Command Injection, XXE, XSS, template injection, etc.) relevant to the API's technology stack and data handling. Verify that defenses are effective.
    - [ ] Test parsers for complex data types (XML, JSON, YAML) with malformed, excessively large, or deeply nested inputs to verify they handle errors gracefully, do not crash, and are not vulnerable to resource exhaustion or injection attacks (e.g., XXE, Billion Laughs).
    - [ ] Perform stress testing by sending high volumes of requests containing invalid data and requests containing excessively large (but structurally valid where applicable, up to defined limits) inputs. Verify the API remains stable, responsive for legitimate traffic, and correctly enforces defined size limits.

### 3.4 Deployment, Operations & Maintenance

    - [ ] Schedule and conduct periodic reviews (e.g., quarterly, or post-incident) of input validation rules and configurations against emerging threats (e.g., new OWASP Top 10, CVEs related to input processing) and application changes. Document review outcomes and track updates to rules.
    - [ ] Subscribe to security mailing lists, vulnerability databases (e.g., NVD, project-specific advisories for used frameworks/libraries), and threat intelligence feeds. Establish a documented process to review new, relevant injection vectors and update input validation rules, defenses, and tests accordingly.
    - [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting for:
      - High rates of input validation failures (overall or per endpoint/IP).
      - Specific types of validation failures (e.g., patterns indicative of scanning or attack).
      - Failures originating from specific IP addresses/clients.
        Investigate alerts promptly to identify potential attacks, misconfigured clients, or API bugs.

## 4. Logging, Monitoring & Auditing

*Focus: Ensuring comprehensive and secure logging, effective monitoring for threats and anomalies, and robust audit trails for accountability and incident investigation.*

### 4.1 Design & Architecture

- [ ] Define and document a logging standard specifying: log format (e.g., JSON, CEF), required fields (timestamp, event ID, source IP, user ID, correlation ID, severity), log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL), and log storage/retention policies. Ensure this standard is version-controlled.
- [ ] Design logging mechanisms to use a dedicated, configurable logging library/framework. Plan for log shipping to a centralized Log Management System (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk) that supports searching, filtering, and alerting.
- [ ] Identify and document critical security events that MUST be logged for audit purposes. This includes, at a minimum:
  - [ ] Authentication attempts (success/failure, source IP, user ID).
  - [ ] Authorization decisions (success/failure, user ID, resource, attempted action).
  - [ ] All administrative actions (e.g., user creation, role changes, configuration changes).
  - [ ] Access to or modification of sensitive data.
  - [ ] Key management events (generation, rotation, deletion).
  - [ ] API key lifecycle events.
  - [ ] Significant security control failures or bypasses.
- [ ] For each event, design logs to include: timestamp (UTC, synchronized), source IP, authenticated user/service ID, event type/ID, target resource, action performed, outcome (success/failure), and any relevant error codes or messages.
- [ ] Design for secure log transport (e.g., TLS) from API servers to the centralized log management system. Plan for secure log storage, including protection against tampering (e.g., append-only, WORM) and unauthorized access (encryption at rest, strong access controls).
- [ ] Design mechanisms to ensure log integrity, such as periodic hashing of log files, digital signing of log entries, or using log management systems that provide built-in integrity checks.
- [ ] Design the logging pipeline (agents, collectors, centralized system) for high availability and fault tolerance. Plan for local buffering on API servers to prevent log loss if the centralized system is temporarily unavailable. Ensure the logging system can scale to handle peak log volumes.
- [ ] Plan for monitoring the health and performance of the logging system itself: agent health, queue depths, processing rates, storage capacity, and query performance of the log management system.

### 4.2 Development & Implementation

- [ ] Implement logging according to the defined standard, ensuring log messages are human-readable and provide sufficient context for troubleshooting and security investigations. Implement and verify mechanisms (e.g., allow-lists, redaction patterns) to prevent sensitive data (passwords, API keys, PII, full credit card numbers) from being written to logs. Document what is and isn't logged.
- [ ] Implement audit trails logging all defined security-relevant events with sufficient detail as per design.
- [ ] Implement and verify controls to prevent sensitive data (session tokens, passwords, full API keys, unmasked PII, full payment card details) from being logged. If partial sensitive data is logged for correlation (e.g., last 4 digits of a CC), ensure this is documented and approved. Use tokenization or masking for any sensitive data that must be referenced in logs.
- [ ] Implement logging using asynchronous processing where possible to minimize the performance impact on API request handling. Benchmark the performance overhead of logging and optimize as needed.

### 4.3 Testing & Validation

- [ ] Develop and execute tests to verify that all defined auditable events are logged correctly, in the specified format, and with the correct details for various scenarios (e.g., successful login, failed login, resource access, permission denied, critical errors).
- [ ] Test and verify that log rotation, retention, and archiving mechanisms function as per the documented policy (e.g., logs are rotated daily, retained for 90 days in hot storage, archived for 1 year).
- [ ] During security testing (including penetration tests), verify that all specified security events are logged accurately and completely, and that attempts to bypass logging or tamper with logs are detected/prevented.
- [ ] Periodically test log protection mechanisms: attempt to modify/delete logs directly, attempt to access logs with unauthorized credentials, and verify that tamper-evident features (if implemented) work as expected.
- [ ] Conduct regular automated and manual reviews of log content (from all environments) to ensure no sensitive data is being inadvertently logged. Use automated tools to scan logs for known patterns of sensitive data.
- [ ] Conduct load testing of the logging infrastructure to ensure it can handle peak API traffic without dropping logs or significantly impacting API performance. Simulate failures in the logging pipeline (e.g., collector down) to verify resilience and recovery.

### 4.4 Deployment, Operations & Maintenance

- [ ] Schedule and conduct periodic reviews (e.g., quarterly) of logging configurations, log content, and log management processes. Update based on operational needs, incident lessons learned, and new threat intelligence.
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for the centralized log management system, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access logs, with appropriate permissions (e.g., read-only for most, administrative for log system admins).
- [ ] Implement secure log management: ensure logs are transmitted securely, protected from tampering and unauthorized access (e.g., append-only storage, log signing, restricted access, encryption at rest).
- [ ] Define and enforce log retention periods based on business needs, legal, and regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR). Ensure the log management system automatically enforces these retention policies.
- [ ] Schedule and conduct periodic reviews (e.g., annually or as regulations change) of audit log configurations, the list of auditable events, log content, access controls, and retention policies with stakeholders from security, legal, and compliance teams.
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting for the entire logging pipeline. Alert on failures or performance degradation.
- [ ] Configure the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) or log management system to generate real-time alerts for predefined suspicious activities and security events. Examples:
  - [ ] Multiple failed login attempts for a single user or from a single IP.
  - [ ] Attempts to access unauthorized resources.
  - [ ] Evidence of injection attacks (e.g., specific patterns in logs).
  - [ ] Anomalous API usage patterns (e.g., sudden spike in requests, unusual data exfiltration).
  - [ ] Critical system errors.
- [ ] Define and document alert thresholds and response procedures for these alerts.

## 5. Error Handling, Resilience & Availability

*Focus: Ensuring the API handles errors gracefully, remains available to legitimate users, and can withstand/recover from failures, stress, and attacks.*

### 5.1 Design & Architecture

- [ ] Design a global error handling mechanism/middleware to standardize error responses across all API endpoints. Define a consistent error response schema (e.g., including a unique error ID for correlation, a generic message, and optionally, specific error codes for client-side logic). Document this schema.
- [ ] When designing resilience patterns like client-side retries, server-side circuit breakers, or bulkheads, ensure they are configurable and their state (e.g., circuit open/closed) is observable/loggable for testing and monitoring purposes.
- [ ] Design a strategy for graceful error handling where client-facing errors return a generic message (e.g., "An internal error occurred," "Invalid request") and an appropriate HTTP status code. Detailed diagnostic information, including stack traces (if applicable), request details, and a unique error ID (for correlation), must be logged internally only.
- [ ] Define and plan for implementation of rate limits (e.g., requests per second/minute/hour) and throttling policies based on various criteria (e.g., per API key, per user ID, per source IP address). Differentiate limits for different types of requests if necessary (e.g., higher limits for reads, lower for writes). Document these limits for API consumers.
- [ ] Plan for Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation:
  - [ ] Utilize API gateway capabilities for traffic management, request validation, and DoS protection.
  - [ ] Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the API.
  - [ ] For critical APIs, consider specialized DDoS mitigation services.
- [ ] Design the API and its infrastructure for fault tolerance:
  - [ ] Use load balancing across multiple instances.
  - [ ] Implement health checks for API instances and dependencies.
  - [ ] Design for statelessness where possible to simplify scaling and recovery.
  - [ ] Define recovery objectives (RTO/RPO) for the API.

### 5.2 Development & Implementation

- [ ] Implement the global error handling mechanism consistently across the API.
- [ ] Implement the centralized and consistent graceful error handling. Ensure that no sensitive information (e.g., internal file paths, server names, database structures, raw exception messages from libraries, configuration details) is ever included in error responses sent to clients.
- [ ] Log detailed error information internally for debugging, including a unique error ID that can be provided to clients for support if necessary.
- [ ] Implement robust rate limiting and throttling at the API gateway or within the API. Ensure that when limits are exceeded, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` status code, optionally with a `Retry-After` header.
- [ ] Profile API performance to identify and optimize resource-intensive operations. For operations that may take significant time to complete, implement an asynchronous processing pattern (e.g., return a `202 Accepted` with a link to poll for status, or use webhooks).

### 5.3 Testing & Validation

- [ ] Develop unit and integration tests to verify that the API returns the correct HTTP status codes (e.g., 4xx, 5xx) and error response structures for various failure conditions (e.g., invalid input, authentication failure, authorization failure, resource not found, internal server errors).
- [ ] Conduct chaos engineering experiments or simulate failures (e.g., dependency service down, network latency) to test the effectiveness of resilience mechanisms like circuit breakers, retries, and fallbacks. Verify that the system behaves as expected and recovers gracefully.
- [ ] During security testing (manual and automated), specifically probe for information leakage in error responses by triggering various error conditions (e.g., sending malformed requests, unexpected data types, probing non-existent resources). Verify no sensitive data is leaked.
- [ ] Conduct tests to verify that rate limiting and throttling mechanisms trigger correctly when defined thresholds are exceeded and that they effectively protect the API from overload.
- [ ] Conduct controlled DoS simulation tests (with appropriate approvals and notifications) to validate the effectiveness of WAF rules, API gateway protections, and infrastructure resilience. Test failover and recovery procedures.
- [ ] During failure testing, verify that even when components fail, the API handles errors gracefully (as per Trustworthiness guidelines) and logs sufficient diagnostic information internally to aid in recovery and root cause analysis.

### 5.4 Deployment, Operations & Maintenance

- [ ] Establish a process for regularly reviewing aggregated error logs (e.g., weekly) to identify common error types, frequently failing endpoints, or patterns indicating underlying bugs, misconfigurations, or abuse. Track remediation of identified issues.
- [ ] Periodically sample and review production error responses (or configure automated checks) to ensure they remain generic and do not start leaking internal details due to code changes or misconfigurations.
- [ ] Employ and configure WAF and other DoS/DDoS mitigation techniques as designed.
- [ ] Implement regular, automated backups of critical API data and all configurations (application, infrastructure, WAF, API gateway). Develop a comprehensive Disaster Recovery (DR) plan and Business Continuity Plan (BCP) for the API. Test the DR plan at least annually, including full recovery drills.

## 6. API Lifecycle & Design Integrity

*Focus: Ensuring the API is well-designed for securability, properly documented, versioned, and that security is integrated throughout its lifecycle.*

### 6.1 Design & Architecture

- [ ] Generate API documentation using a standard format like OpenAPI Specification (OAS). Ensure documentation includes:
  - [ ] All available endpoints, HTTP methods, and parameters (path, query, header, body).
  - [ ] Detailed request and response schemas, including data types, formats, and constraints for every field.
  - [ ] Example request and response payloads.
  - [ ] Authentication and authorization requirements for each endpoint.
  - [ ] All possible status codes and error response schemas.
  - [ ] Rate limits and usage quotas.
  - [ ] Security considerations (e.g., specific headers required, data sensitivity).
    Automate documentation generation from code/annotations where possible. Store documentation in version control.
- [ ] Define and document a clear API versioning strategy (e.g., URI path versioning like `/v1/`, `/v2/`, or header-based versioning). Document the lifecycle for each API version, including timelines for deprecation (period during which it\'s supported but discouraged) and retirement (when it\'s no longer available). Communicate this policy to API consumers.
- [ ] During design, explicitly consider how security controls will be tested. For example:
  - [ ] Ensure administrative interfaces are available (with strong auth) to manage users, roles, and permissions for testing authorization.
  - [ ] Design endpoints or mechanisms to query the status of security configurations or states (e.g., current cryptographic algorithms in use, status of a circuit breaker) for verification, if safe to do so.
  - [ ] Ensure the API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI spec) serves as the contract and explicitly states security expectations for clients, such as:
    - [ ] How to securely authenticate (e.g., "Clients MUST use OAuth 2.0 with PKCE").
    - [ ] Responsibility for securing client-side credentials.
    - [ ] Expected secure handling of sensitive data received from the API.
- [ ] Design the API for consistency and predictability:
  - [ ] Use consistent naming conventions for URLs, parameters, and fields.
  - [ ] Use standard HTTP methods appropriately and consistently.
  - [ ] Return consistent status codes for similar situations across different endpoints.
  - [ ] Implement pagination, filtering, and sorting in a standardized way if applicable.

### 6.2 Development & Implementation

- [ ] Integrate API documentation updates into the development workflow. Ensure that any change to API functionality, request/response structure, authentication, or security behavior is reflected in the documentation before or at the time of deployment.
- [ ] Implement the defined API versioning strategy consistently across all endpoints. Ensure that requests to non-existent or unsupported versions are handled gracefully (e.g., `404 Not Found` or a specific error indicating version mismatch).
- [ ] Document the development process and integrate FIASSE activities into each phase of development.
- [ ] During development and code review, verify that the implementation strictly adheres to the documented API contract (schemas, status codes, headers) and all defined security design principles (e.g., least privilege, defense-in-depth, secure defaults).
- [ ] Use robust coding practices, thorough testing (unit, integration, end-to-end), and code reviews to ensure the API implementation reliably meets its design specifications under various conditions, including edge cases and high load.

### 6.3 Testing & Validation

- [ ] As part of the release process, conduct a specific review of the API documentation, focusing on:
  - [ ] Accuracy of endpoint descriptions, parameters, and schemas.
  - [ ] Completeness of authentication/authorization information.
  - [ ] Clarity of security-related instructions or warnings for consumers.
  - [ ] Correctness of example requests/responses.
    Treat documentation bugs with the same severity as code bugs.
- [ ] Develop tests to verify:
  - [ ] Requests to different API versions are routed correctly.
  - [ ] Deprecated API versions behave as documented (e.g., return warning headers, log usage).
  - [ ] Retired API versions are no longer accessible and return appropriate error codes (e.g., `410 Gone`).
- [ ] Implement automated contract testing (e.g., using tools like Pact or by validating against the OpenAPI spec) to ensure the API implementation does not deviate from its documented contract. Pay special attention to verifying security-related aspects of the contract (e.g., authentication requirements, error responses for security failures).
- [ ] Develop test suites that verify consistent API behavior across different supported versions (if applicable) and under various operational conditions (e.g., different data inputs, load levels, concurrent requests). This includes checking for consistent error handling, data formatting, and adherence to defined contracts.

### 6.4 Deployment, Operations & Maintenance

- [ ] Establish a formal process for managing the API version lifecycle. This includes:
  - [ ] Announcing new versions well in advance.
  - [ ] Providing clear timelines and migration guides for deprecated versions.
  - [ ] Communicating directly with known consumers about upcoming retirements.
  - [ ] Monitoring usage of older versions to understand impact before retirement.
- [ ] Ensure that the established secure SDLC process is followed for all maintenance releases, patches, and new feature developments. Schedule periodic reviews (e.g., annually or after major architectural changes) of existing threat models to ensure they remain relevant.
- [ ] Establish a clear communication channel for API consumers (e.g., mailing list, developer portal, release notes). Proactively communicate any changes to the API contract, especially those with security implications (e.g., new security headers, changes in authentication, modified rate limits), well in advance of deployment.
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting to detect deviations from expected API behavior. This can include:
  - [ ] Monitoring for unexpected increases in specific error codes.
  - [ ] Validating response schemas against the defined contract in production (e.g., sampling responses).
  - [ ] Tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) like latency and error rates, and alerting on significant deviations from baselines.

## 7. Secure Configuration, Build & Deployment

*Focus: Ensuring the API and its supporting infrastructure are securely configured, built, and deployed, minimizing misconfigurations and vulnerabilities introduced during these processes.*

### 7.1 Design & Architecture

- [ ] Store all API and infrastructure configurations (e.g., application settings, environment variables, WAF rules, API gateway settings, OS hardening scripts) in a version control system (e.g., Git). Use a structured format (e.g., YAML, JSON, HCL) for configurations. Implement a process for reviewing and approving configuration changes before they are applied.
- [ ] Design a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for building, testing, and deploying the API. Ensure that each stage of the pipeline is testable and that deployments can be reliably rolled back. The pipeline should include automated security checks (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning).
- [ ] Secure the CI/CD pipeline itself:
  - Restrict access to pipeline configurations and build servers using strong authentication and authorization.
  - Use strong, unique credentials (e.g., service principals, secrets management) for pipeline interactions with code repositories, artifact repositories, and deployment targets.
  - Scan build tools and pipeline dependencies for vulnerabilities.
  - Plan for digital signing of build artifacts to ensure their integrity.
  - Log all pipeline activities for audit.
- [ ] Develop and document hardened, secure baseline configurations for all components of the API ecosystem: Operating Systems (e.g., based on CIS Benchmarks), Web servers, Application servers/runtimes, Databases, API Gateway, WAF, Containerization platforms (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes). These baselines should disable unnecessary services/features, enforce strong authentication, configure secure logging, and apply relevant security settings.
- [ ] Design the CI/CD pipeline to ensure deployments are repeatable, predictable, and minimize downtime. Plan for techniques like blue/green deployments or canary releases to reduce the risk of deployment failures impacting all users. Automate pre-deployment checks and post-deployment health checks.

### 7.2 Development & Implementation

- [ ] Define and maintain separate, secure baseline configurations for each environment (development, testing/staging, production). Store these configurations in version control, using branching or separate files to manage differences. Minimize differences between staging and production to ensure accurate testing.
- [ ] Configure web servers and application frameworks to remove or minimize HTTP response headers that reveal specific software versions or technologies (e.g., `Server`, `X-Powered-By`, `X-AspNet-Version`).
- [ ] Implement security-enhancing HTTP headers in API responses:
  - `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS)
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN`
  - `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) - Define a strict policy.
  - `Referrer-Policy`
  - `Permissions-Policy` (formerly `Feature-Policy`)
- [ ] Configure a strict Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy. Only allow specific, trusted origins. Avoid using wildcard (`*`) for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in production unless the API is truly public and designed for it. Validate `Origin` header server-side. Be mindful of `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`.
- [ ] Implement digital signing of build artifacts and verify signatures during deployment.
- [ ] Automate deployment processes fully to reduce manual errors and ensure consistency.

### 7.3 Testing & Validation

- [ ] Regularly test the entire deployment process, including automated rollback procedures. Verify that a rollback can be performed quickly and reliably restores the previous working version without data loss or corruption (where applicable).
- [ ] Implement automated configuration scanning tools (e.g., CIS Benchmark scanners, custom scripts) to continuously audit deployed configurations against defined security baselines and industry best practices. Schedule periodic manual reviews of critical configurations.
- [ ] Use automated tools (e.g., security scanners, custom scripts in CI/CD) and manual checks during security testing to verify that all defined secure configurations are applied correctly and that all required security headers are present and correctly configured in API responses.
- [ ] Specifically test the CORS policy implementation by attempting requests from allowed origins, disallowed origins, and with different HTTP methods and headers to ensure it behaves as expected.
- [ ] Verify through configuration checks and testing that all debugging flags, diagnostic pages, and verbose error reporting features are disabled in the production environment. Configuration for production should explicitly disable these.
- [ ] Periodically test the reliability of the CI/CD pipeline and configuration management tools themselves. Simulate failures in these systems (e.g., build agent down, repository unavailable) to ensure they have appropriate error handling, alerting, and recovery mechanisms.

### 7.4 Deployment, Operations & Maintenance

- [ ] Implement a formal change management process for all configuration modifications. All changes must be:
  - [ ] Tracked in a ticketing system or version control commit history.
  - [ ] Reviewed and approved by authorized personnel.
  - [ ] Tested in a non-production environment before being applied to production.
  - [ ] Documented with the reason for the change and the outcome.
- [ ] Establish a patch management program:
  - [ ] Subscribe to vendor security advisories for all software and hardware components.
  - [ ] Regularly scan for missing patches using vulnerability scanning tools.
  - [ ] Prioritize and apply security patches based on risk (e.g., CVSS score, exploitability, asset criticality).
  - [ ] Test patches in a staging environment before deploying to production.
  - [ ] Track patch deployment status.
- [ ] Implement network segmentation to isolate development, staging, and production environments from each other and from other corporate networks. Use firewalls (network and host-based) to enforce strict access control rules between segments, allowing only necessary traffic on specific ports/protocols.
- [ ] Configure web servers and application servers to disable directory listing/browsing. Ensure that no unnecessary files (e.g., configuration backups, source code, internal documentation, test scripts) or services (e.g., debugging ports, management interfaces) are exposed to the internet or unauthorized networks.
- [ ] Implement comprehensive monitoring for all infrastructure components (servers, databases, network devices, API gateway, WAF):
  - [ ] Monitor key performance indicators (CPU, memory, disk, network I/O).
  - [ ] Monitor service availability and response times.
  - [ ] Monitor configuration drift (detect unauthorized or unexpected changes to configurations).
  - [ ] Alert on failures, performance degradation, or security-related configuration changes.

## 8. Dependency Management

*Focus: Managing the security of third-party libraries, frameworks, and other components used by the API to prevent vulnerabilities inherited from dependencies.*

### Design & Architecture

- [ ] Define and document a formal process for selecting and approving third-party libraries, frameworks, and other software components. This process should include:
  - [ ] Security assessment (known vulnerabilities, project activity, security practices of the maintainers, origin of the component).
  - [ ] License compliance checks.
  - [ ] Performance and stability considerations.
    Maintain a central, version-controlled inventory of all approved components and their approved versions.
- [ ] Establish a schedule (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly, or on-commit via CI) for checking all third-party dependencies for newly disclosed vulnerabilities and available updates/patches.
- [ ] Prioritize using dependencies from well-known, reputable sources (e.g., official project websites, trusted package repositories). Evaluate the project's history, community activity, responsiveness to security issues, and use of secure development practices. Verify checksums/signatures of downloaded dependencies.
- [ ] When selecting dependencies, consider their stability, maturity, community support, and official support lifecycle. Avoid dependencies that are unmaintained, deprecated, or known to be unstable, as they can introduce reliability issues.

### Development & Implementation

- [ ] Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to automatically generate and maintain an accurate inventory (Software Bill of Materials - SBOM) of all direct and transitive dependencies, including their exact versions. Store this SBOM in version control and update it with every build.
- [ ] Periodically review the API's codebase and dependency tree to identify and remove any unused or obsolete dependencies, modules, or features. This reduces the attack surface and simplifies maintenance.
- [ ] After updating any dependency, run a full suite of regression tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) to ensure that the update has not introduced functional issues or performance degradation. Pay special attention to areas of the API that directly use or interact with the updated dependency.

### Testing & Validation

- [ ] Integrate SCA tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, Dependabot, GitHub Advanced Security) into the CI/CD pipeline. Configure the pipeline to fail the build or alert if dependencies with known vulnerabilities above a defined severity threshold are detected.
- [ ] During penetration testing and security assessments, specifically consider the security implications of key dependencies. Test for known vulnerabilities in those dependencies and how they might be exploited in the context of the API.
- [ ] Develop specific integration tests that verify the interaction between the API and its critical dependencies under various conditions. This helps catch issues related to compatibility, configuration, or unexpected behavior of the dependency.

### Deployment, Operations & Maintenance

- [ ] Define a vulnerability management policy for third-party dependencies, including:
  - [ ] Timelines for patching or mitigating vulnerabilities based on severity (e.g., critical vulnerabilities within 72 hours, high within 2 weeks).
  - [ ] Process for evaluating the applicability and impact of a vulnerability.
  - [ ] Procedures for testing and deploying updated dependencies.
  - [ ] Options if a patch is not available (e.g., virtual patching with WAF, disabling affected functionality, replacing the component).
    Track all remediation efforts.
- [ ] Subscribe to vulnerability feeds, security mailing lists (e.g., oss-security), and vendor advisories relevant to the technologies and dependencies used in the API. Use SCA tools that automatically update their vulnerability databases and re-scan dependencies.
- [ ] As part of the dependency update process, ensure there is a clear and tested rollback plan. If an updated dependency causes critical issues in production, be prepared to quickly revert to the previous known-good version of the dependency and the API.

- **Deployment, Operations & Maintenance:**

## 9. Security Testing & Verification

*Focus: Actively identifying and verifying security vulnerabilities and control effectiveness through various testing methodologies throughout the SDLC.*

### 9.1 Design & Architecture

- [ ] Develop and document a comprehensive security testing strategy that defines:
  - Types of testing to be performed (e.g., SAST, DAST, IAST, manual penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, fuzz testing, manual code review).
  - Scope and frequency of each type of testing (e.g., SAST on every commit, DAST in CI/CD, penetration test annually or per major release).
  - Tools and methodologies to be used.
  - Responsibilities for conducting tests and remediating findings.
  - Criteria for test success/failure and vulnerability acceptance.
    Store this strategy in version control.
- [ ] Reiterate the importance of designing for testability: ensure security controls have observable outcomes, administrative interfaces (secured) are available for configuring test scenarios (e.g., user roles, permissions), and logging provides sufficient detail for verifying test actions.
- [ ] For each type of security testing, define clear, measurable acceptance criteria. This should include:
  - What constitutes a "pass" or "fail".
  - Severity thresholds for vulnerabilities that must be remediated before release (e.g., "No critical or high vulnerabilities allowed in production").
  - Requirements for documentation of findings and remediation efforts.
  - Process for risk acceptance for vulnerabilities that cannot be immediately fixed, with explicit approval from designated authorities.
- [ ] When designing and executing security tests (especially DAST or penetration tests) in shared testing environments, plan tests to minimize disruption to other testing activities. This might involve:
  - Scheduling intrusive tests during off-peak hours.
  - Using dedicated test accounts and data that can be easily reset.
  - Coordinating with other teams using the environment.

### 9.2 Development & Implementation

- [ ] Develop security-focused unit tests (e.g., testing individual input validators, access control functions) and integration tests (e.g., testing authentication flows, authorization logic across components). Integrate these automated tests into the CI/CD pipeline to run on every code change.
- [ ] Establish a vulnerability management process that includes:
  - [ ] Triaging identified vulnerabilities (verifying, assessing severity using a standard like CVSS, determining impact).
  - [ ] Prioritizing remediation based on risk.
  - [ ] Assigning responsibility for fixing vulnerabilities.
  - [ ] Tracking remediation progress using a bug tracking system.
- [ ] Ensure security scanning or monitoring tools deployed in production (e.g., RASP, production DAST if used) are configured and tested to ensure they do not introduce significant performance overhead or stability risks to the API.

### 9.3 Testing & Validation

- [ ] Perform manual security testing focused on identifying business logic flaws. This involves understanding the API\'s intended functionality and then attempting to abuse it in ways not covered by standard vulnerability scanners (e.g., exploiting race conditions, bypassing workflow steps, manipulating business rules for financial gain or unauthorized access). Document test cases and findings.
- [ ] Develop a detailed test plan specifically for verifying the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) implementation. This should include:
  - [ ] Creating test users with different roles/attributes.
  - [ ] Attempting to access resources and perform actions allowed and disallowed by their roles/attributes.
  - [ ] Testing for both horizontal (accessing data of other users at the same privilege level) and vertical (gaining higher privileges) privilege escalation.
  - [ ] Verifying that default deny principles are enforced.
- [ ] Prioritize security testing efforts on the most critical functionalities of the API (e.g., authentication, authorization, payment processing, handling of sensitive data) and known threat vectors relevant to the API's technology stack and business domain (e.g., OWASP API Security Top 10).
- [ ] After a vulnerability has been remediated, perform re-testing specifically targeting that vulnerability to confirm that the fix is effective and has not introduced any regressions. This validation should be done by someone other than the developer who implemented the fix, if possible, or through automated tests.
- [ ] During security testing, specifically test the failure modes of security controls (e.g., what happens if the authentication service is down? What if the WAF fails?). Ensure that security mechanisms are designed to "fail secure" (e.g., deny access by default) and that their failure does not lead to a cascading failure that compromises the overall reliability or availability of the API for legitimate users.

### 9.4 Deployment, Operations & Maintenance

- [ ] Ensure that the full suite of relevant automated security tests (SAST, DAST, security unit/integration tests) is executed automatically after any significant code change, infrastructure change, or dependency update. Schedule periodic full security assessments (including penetration tests) even in the absence of major changes.
- [ ] Regularly review and update security test plans to reflect changes in the API, new threat vectors, and evolving best practices. Keep security testing tools (scanners, fuzzers, etc.) and their rule sets/signatures up to date.
- [ ] Conduct periodic, independent penetration tests (e.g., annually, after major changes) by qualified third-party or internal red teams. Ensure the scope covers all API endpoints and relevant infrastructure. Track remediation of findings.
- [ ] Treat security testing findings not just as bugs to be fixed, but as learning opportunities. Analyze trends in vulnerabilities, identify root causes, and use this information to improve development practices, security training, and the overall design and resilience of the API. Share lessons learned across development teams.

## 10. Incident Response & Business Continuity

*Focus: Preparing for, responding to, and recovering from security incidents and disruptions to ensure operational resilience and minimize impact.*

### 10.1  Design & Architecture

- [ ] Develop a documented Incident Response (IR) plan specifically tailored to potential security incidents affecting the API. This plan should include:
  - [ ] Defined roles and responsibilities for the IR team.
  - [ ] Phases of incident response (Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned).
  - [ ] Specific procedures for common API-related incidents (e.g., data breach, DoS attack, account compromise, vulnerability exploitation).
  - [ ] Communication plan (internal stakeholders, external parties like customers or regulators).
  - [ ] Contact lists for key personnel and third-party support.
    Store the IR plan in a readily accessible location.
- [ ] Define and document clear procedures for forensically sound evidence collection and preservation related to API incidents. This should cover:
  - [ ] What data to collect (logs from all relevant systems, memory dumps if appropriate, network traffic captures, system images).
  - [ ] How to collect it without tampering (e.g., order of volatility).
  - [ ] Chain of custody procedures.
  - [ ] Secure storage of evidence.
- [ ] Define clear internal and external communication protocols as part of the IR plan. This includes:
  - [ ] Who is authorized to communicate about an incident.
  - [ ] What information can be shared and with whom, at what stage.
  - [ ] Templates for different types of communications (e.g., internal alerts, customer notifications, regulatory disclosures).
  - [ ] Channels for communication (e.g., dedicated email, status page, phone bridge).
    Ensure legal and PR teams are involved in crafting external communications.
- [ ] Develop and document a comprehensive Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and Disaster Recovery (DR) plan for the API. This should include:
  - [ ] Business Impact Analysis (BIA) to identify critical API functions and recovery objectives (RTO/RPO).
  - [ ] DR strategies for different types of disasters (e.g., data center outage, cyberattack causing data corruption).
  - [ ] Procedures for failing over to a secondary site or recovering services.
  - [ ] Roles and responsibilities for BCP/DR execution.
  - [ ] Communication plan for BCP/DR events.
- [ ] Assess the BCP/DR capabilities of critical third-party services or internal dependencies that the API relies on. If a critical dependency does not have adequate BCP/DR, develop contingency plans or identify alternative providers/solutions.

### 10.2 Development & Implementation

- [ ] Ensure IR team members are trained on the IR plan and evidence collection procedures.
- Testing & Validation:
- [ ] Conduct regular tests of the API IR plan, such as:
  - [ ] Tabletop exercises (discussing hypothetical scenarios) - e.g., quarterly.
  - [ ] Simulation exercises (simulating parts of an incident response) - e.g., semi-annually.
    Use the results of these tests to identify gaps and improve the plan.
- Deployment, Operations & Maintenance:
- [ ] Review and update the IR plan and evidence collection procedures at least annually, or after any significant incident or architectural change.
- [ ] Integrate security alerting from monitoring systems (Section 4) into the incident identification process of the IR plan.
- [ ] Implement robust, automated data backup procedures for all critical API data. Define backup frequency, retention periods, and storage locations (e.g., off-site, immutable).

### 10.3 Testing & Validation

- [ ] During IR plan tests (tabletop/simulations), specifically test the communication protocols and decision-making processes.
- [ ] Conduct regular tests of the BCP/DR plan, including:
  - [ ] Component failover tests (e.g., database, specific microservice).
  - [ ] Full DR drills to a secondary site (if applicable) - e.g., annually.
  - [ ] Data restoration tests from backups, verifying data integrity post-restoration - e.g., quarterly.
    Use test results to validate RTO/RPO capabilities and identify areas for improvement.

### 10.4 Deployment, Operations & Maintenance

- [ ] During an incident, provide timely updates to relevant internal stakeholders. After an incident, and based on legal and PR guidance, communicate transparently with affected customers and regulatory bodies as required by law or policy. Focus on facts, impact, remediation actions, and steps taken to prevent recurrence.
- [ ] After every significant security incident or near-miss, conduct a thorough post-incident review (lessons learned or root cause analysis). The goals are to:
  - [ ] Understand the full timeline and impact of the incident.
  - [ ] Identify the root cause(s).
  - [ ] Evaluate the effectiveness of the IR plan and execution.
  - [ ] Identify areas for improvement in security controls, processes, or technology.
    [ ] Track action items from the review to completion.
- [ ] Review and update the BCP/DR plan at least annually, or after significant infrastructure/architectural changes or DR tests.
- [ ] Ensure that API dependencies' BCP/DR plans are periodically reviewed or that contractual SLAs cover necessary availability and recovery.
