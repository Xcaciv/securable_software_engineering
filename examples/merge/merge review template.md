# FIASSE-Integrated Merge Review Checklist

This checklist is designed to guide merge/pull request reviews with a focus on the principles of the Framework for Integrating Application Security into Software Engineering (FIASSE) and the Securable Software Engineering Model (SSEM). Its goal is to foster a mindset of building inherently securable software by focusing on core engineering attributes.

## I. Clarity, Understanding & Evolution (Maintainability Focus)

These questions help assess if the code is well-structured for long-term security and adaptation.

- **[ ] Understandability (Analyzability):**
  - Is the purpose of this code clear and easy to grasp, even for someone unfamiliar with it?
  - Are names (variables, functions, classes) descriptive and unambiguous?
  - Are comments used effectively to explain *why* something is done, especially for complex or non-obvious logic?
  - Is the code's complexity (e.g., nesting depth, number of paths) managed, or is it overly intricate?

- **[ ] Ease of Modification (Modifiability):**
  - If a related change or bug fix were needed in the future, could it be made with reasonable effort and without a high risk of breaking other parts?
  - Does this change avoid unnecessary duplication of code or logic?
  - Are the connections (coupling) between this code and other parts of the system well-defined and minimized where appropriate?

- **[ ] Verifiability of Correctness (Testability - Engineering Perspective):**
  - Is the code structured in a way that its behavior and correctness can be confidently verified (e.g., through focused manual checks, observing outputs for given inputs)?
  - Are distinct responsibilities separated, making it easier to reason about each part?

## II. Building Trustworthy Systems (Trustworthiness Focus)

These questions address the inherent qualities that make software dependable and its operations reliable from a security standpoint.

- **[ ] Information Protection (Confidentiality):**
  - If this code handles sensitive information (e.g., PII, credentials, business secrets), are appropriate measures taken to protect it from unauthorized disclosure or access?

- **[ ] Action Traceability (Accountability & Non-repudiation):**
  - For significant actions performed by this code, are there adequate records (e.g., logs) to determine what happened, when, and by which entity (user/system)?
  - Is logged information sufficient for understanding system behavior and for potential incident investigation?

- **[ ] Identity Verification (Authenticity):**
  - If this code involves interactions where identity is important (e.g., users, other services), are identities reliably established and checked?

## III. Ensuring Reliable & Predictable Operation (Reliability Focus)

These questions focus on the software's ability to perform its functions correctly and consistently, even under adverse conditions.

- **[ ] System Accessibility (Availability):**
  - Does this change consider how the system (or this part of it) remains operational and accessible to authorized users when needed?

- **[ ] Data & Process Soundness (Integrity):**
  - Are measures in place to ensure that data is not accidentally or maliciously altered in unauthorized ways?
  - Does the system behave as intended, free from unauthorized manipulation of its processes?

- **[ ] Handling Errors & Failures (Fault Tolerance):**
  - How does this code respond to potential errors or failures (e.g., invalid data, unavailable external services, resource exhaustion)? Does it handle them gracefully?

- **[ ] Predictable Behavior Under Stress (Resilience):**
  - Does the code handle inputs safely, especially those from less trusted sources or crossing trust boundaries? (e.g., proper validation, sanitization).
  - Is the code written defensively to maintain predictable behavior even in unexpected situations or under load?

## IV. Design & Process Integration (FIASSE in Practice)

These questions ensure security is considered throughout the development lifecycle.

- **[ ] Meeting Defined Expectations (Requirements & Planning):**
  - Were specific security considerations, threat scenarios, or security-related acceptance criteria defined for this feature/change?
  - Does this implementation adequately address those defined security expectations?

- **[ ] Managing Trust Boundaries:**
  - Are points where data or control passes between areas of different trust levels (e.g., user input, API calls, database interactions) clearly identified?
  - Are appropriate controls (e.g., strict validation, least privilege, careful data handling) applied at these trust boundaries?

- **[ ] Flexibility vs. Control:**
  - Where the code offers flexibility, is it appropriately controlled to prevent misuse, especially at trust boundaries?

- **[ ] Dependency Management (If new/updated dependencies):**
  - **Understanding:** Is the purpose and scope of the new/updated dependency (and its transitive dependencies) well understood?
  - **Source & Integrity:** Is the dependency from a trusted source, and has its integrity been verified (if possible)?
  - **Maintainability:** Is the dependency known for being well-maintained? Is our system designed to allow for its update or replacement if needed?
  - **Impact:** How could a failure or compromise of this dependency affect our system's reliability and trustworthiness?

## V. Overall Engineering Craftsmanship

- **[ ] Alignment with "Resiliently Add Computing Value":**
  - Does this change contribute positively to the system's ability to deliver value robustly and adapt to future needs and threats?
- **[ ] Readability and Simplicity:**
  - Is the code as simple as possible, but no simpler? Is it free of unnecessary complexity?

**Reviewer Notes:**

*(Space for reviewers to add specific comments or observations related to the checklist items)*

---

**Outcome:**

- [ ] Approved
- [ ] Approved with minor suggestions
- [ ] Changes requested

---

This checklist is a guide, not a rigid mandate. The depth of review for each item may vary based on the nature and criticality of the change. The primary goal is to encourage thoughtful consideration of these securable attributes during the development and review process.
