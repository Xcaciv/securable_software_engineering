# Copilot Instructions for Secure Python Development

This document defines security guidelines for Python projects. It emphasizes best practices across all development stages while following the **FAISE** framework—**Foundational**, **Architectural**, **Implementation**, **Security Controls**, and **Evaluation**. These instructions are informed by the recommendations in the [FIASSE RFC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xcaciv/securable_software_engineering/refs/heads/main/docs/FIASSE-RFC.md) and the [OWASP Python Security Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Python_Security_Cheat_Sheet.md).

## Overview

- **Objective:** Ensure that Python applications are built with robust security controls, minimizing risk and maintaining integrity throughout the development lifecycle.
- **FAISE Framework:**  
  - **Foundational:** Establish a secure development environment and dependency management.
  - **Architectural:** Structure your application with secure defaults and strict component isolation.
  - **Implementation:** Write secure code using modern Python idioms and safe libraries.
  - **Security Controls:** Implement runtime security measures (e.g., authentication, logging, and error isolation).
  - **Evaluation:** Regularly audit and test your codebase using static and dynamic analysis tools.

---

## 1. Foundational

- **Environment Isolation:**  
  - Always develop within virtual environments (using `venv` or similar tools) to isolate dependencies and prevent system-level conflicts.
  - Enforce *dependency pinning* (via `pip-tools`, `poetry`, etc.) to avoid unexpected upgrades or vulnerabilities.

- **Dependency Security:**  
  - Regularly scan for vulnerabilities using tools like [Safety](https://pypi.org/project/safety/) or `pip-audit`.
  - Periodically review and update dependencies in line with known vulnerability advisories.

---

## 2. Architectural

- **Configuration Management:**  
  - Centralize configuration and sensitive information management (e.g., using environment variables, `.env` files, or secure vaults like AWS Secrets Manager).
  - Maintain clear separation of development, testing, and production environments. Enable secure communication protocols (e.g., enforce HTTPS by default).

- **Principle of Least Privilege:**  
  - Architect your system with strict access controls so that modules only have the minimum access required to function.
  - Consider microservices or modularized designs to reduce the impact of a single component failure.

---

## 3. Implementation

- **Input Validation & Sanitization:**  
  - Sanitize all data inputs to prevent injection attacks. Regularly use libraries such as `bleach` for HTML content and `schema` for data structure validation.
  - Validate input at the boundary of your application to intercept malicious data as early as possible.

- **Safe Data Handling:**  
  - Prefer safe serialization formats (e.g., JSON or `orjson`) over insecure methods such as `pickle`, which can execute arbitrary code on deserialization.
  - Use Python’s formatted string literals (f-strings) or `.format()` over the `%` operator to enhance readability and security.

- **Error Handling:**  
  - Avoid exposing sensitive details in error messages. Implement a robust logging mechanism that sanitizes or redacts sensitive information.
  - Establish clear, centralized error management and exception handling guidelines.

---

## 4. Security Controls

- **Authentication and Authorization:**  
  - Utilize well-maintained libraries (e.g., Flask-Login, Django Auth, or Authlib) to manage user authentication.
  - Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) wherever feasible and verify permissions rigorously.

- **Audit and Logging:**  
  - Log security-critical events with clear timestamps, context information, and user identifiers.
  - Regularly review audit logs to uncover abnormal behaviors or attempt patterns indicative of breaches.

- **Secrets Management:**  
  - Never hardcode API keys, credentials, or other secrets in your codebase. Use environment variables or dedicated API key management services.
  - Consider integrating with cloud-native secret management solutions for enhanced security.

---

## 5. Evaluation

- **Static Analysis:**  
  - Integrate tools such as `bandit` and `pylint` (with security plugins) into your continuous integration (CI) process to catch vulnerabilities early.
  - Run regular static code analyses as part of routine code reviews.

- **Dynamic Testing:**  
  - Adopt dynamic testing, including fuzzing and penetration testing, to simulate real-world attacks.
  - Encourage developers to write security-centric tests using frameworks like `pytest` to validate secure coding patterns.

- **Threat Modeling:**  
  - Conduct periodic threat modeling sessions to assess security risks and adjust controls accordingly.
  - Stay informed on emerging threats specific to Python by following relevant security mailing lists and advisories.

---

## Additional Recommendations

- **Documentation and Training:**  
  - Maintain comprehensive documentation of your secure development practices.
  - Educate your team about these guidelines and encourage the use of code checklists to ensure adherence.

- **Secure Defaults:**  
  - Ensure your production configurations disable debug modes (`DEBUG=False`) and enforce proper error handling.
  - Regularly review dependency licenses to ensure compliance with organizational policies.

- **Tooling Integration:**  
  - Consider integrating additional security tools or custom linters to complement established best practices.
  - Automate as much of the security assessment as possible through CI/CD pipelines, making security a continuous process.

By integrating these guidelines into your Python projects, your development workflow can proactively manage risks and foster a secure, resilient application environment. This file serves as an evolving blueprint: update practices as new threats emerge and reflect emerging best practices in Python security.
