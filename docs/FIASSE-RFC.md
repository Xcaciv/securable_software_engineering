## Abstract

This document describes the Framework for Integrating Application Security into Software Engineering (FIASSE). It is a vendor-independent framework designed to integrate application security principles and practices directly into the software engineering discipline. FIASSE addresses the following common challenges:

- Friction between Application Security (AppSec) and Development teams
- Perceived slow progress in enhancing software security
- Scaling AppSec
- The need to empower developers to build securable code without requiring them to become penetration testing experts

Within this framework, the Securable Software Engineering Model (SSEM) provides a specific design language based on established software engineering terms, focusing on inherent security attributes of code and software architecture. This document outlines the core principles, attributes, and actionable insights for developers. SSEM also defines a durable model as the foundation for the framework. The goal is to resiliently add computing value (see Section 2.2) while reducing the probability of material impact from cyber events (see Section 2.3) in the ever changing world of software engineering.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. The Application Security Challenge

Organizations invest significantly in secure coding initiatives and security testing tools, yet often do not observe commensurate outcomes in application security (AppSec). Tangible progress can feel slow, and friction between AppSec and Development teams is a common impediment.Â The friction between AppSec and Development teams is further complicated by Generative AI tools for code generation. While powerful, these tools can amplify past security mistakes or introduce new vulnerabilities if not guided by sound engineering principles. Ensuring AI-generated code is securable is a new facet of this challenge. A fundamental question arises: how can development teams consistently create securable code if they lack deep security expertise?
Furthermore, many well-intentioned strategies, including the prevalent "shift left" movement, have often produced disappointing results in practice, failing to impact the software produced.

### 1.2. A Developer-Centric Security Paradigm

This document advocates for a developer-centric security paradigm. Rather than expecting software engineers to adopt an adversarial mindset (a distinction further explored in Section 2.4), this approach emphasizes empowering developers. While leveraging sound software engineering principles is foundational, it is complemented by clear security requirements and robust assurance activities. With these elements effectively integrated, engineers can build securable systems as a natural part of their discipline. A common misconception is that the gap between security and development is inherently problematic; the real issue is the lack of consideration for the business processes and skillsets involved in producing software. This document makes the case that the gap is a non-issue; rather, it is the lack of consideration for the business processes and skillsets involved in producing software.

### 1.3. Document Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this document is to introduce the Framework for Integrating Application Security into Software Engineering (FIASSE) and its core component, the Securable Software Engineering Model (SSEM). FIASSE (/feiz/) provides the overarching strategic approach and practices that integrate security into software engineering. SSEM (/si:m/), as a model within FIASSE, offers a common design language and a set of principles to guide the creation of secure software, aligning AppSec objectives with business goals.

The term 'securable' is used throughout this document to emphasize the dynamic nature of software security. See Section 2.1 for a detailed explanation of this term. Because of this dynamic nature, Application Security must align with the business objectives for software development.

This document aims to provide a comprehensive understanding and will cover the following topics:

- Foundational principles underpinning FIASSE and SSEM (see [Section 2. Foundational Principles](#2-foundational-principles))
- The core attributes of securable software as defined by SSEM (see [Section 3.2. Core Securable Attributes](#32-core-securable-attributes))
- Strategies for integrating FIASSE (and SSEM) into existing development processes (see [Section 4. Integrating SSEM into Development Strategy](#4-integrating-ssem-into-development-strategy))
- Common pitfalls in AppSec and how FIASSE helps to avoid them (see [Section 5. Addressing Common AppSec Anti-Patterns](#5-addressing-common-appsec-anti-patterns))
- Practical guidance for developers to build securable code (see [Section 6. Practical Guidance for Secure Software Development](#6-practical-guidance-for-secure-software-development))
- The roles of different engineering personnel in adopting FIASSE (see [Section 7. Roles and Responsibilities in SSEM Adoption](#7-roles-and-responsibilities-in-ssem-adoption))
- The potential evolution of FIASSE in response to emerging software engineering trends and strategies for organizational adoption (see [Section 8. Evolution and Adoption of FIASSE](#8-evolution-and-adoption-of-fiasse))

This document is intended for AppSec professionals, software engineers, engineering managers, and anyone involved in the software development who seeks to improve application security outcomes.

In the context of FIASSE, security organizations may employ both Application Security (AppSec) and Product Security roles. AppSec professionals focus on the technical aspects of security and work directly with developers to integrate SSEM attributes into code and applies FIASSE processes. They are responsible for security assurance and align with development's processes, including prioritization.

Product Security professionals operate at a higher strategic level, translating business risk into security requirements and managing customer communications around security. They also ensure regulatory compliance and align security with broader business objectives.

FIASSE serves as a unifying framework for both roles: SSEM provides the technical language and measurable attributes needed for secure development practices. The framework emphasizes business alignment (Section 2.3) and clear expectations (Section 6.1), enabling Product Security teams to translate strategic security objectives into actionable development requirements with clarity.

Rather than creating silos, FIASSE fosters collaboration by fostering a shared understanding of what constitutes securable software across technical and strategic security functions.

## 2. Foundational Principles

### 2.1. The Securable Paradigm: No Static Secure State

The term "securable" is used throughout this document to emphasize the fundamental principle: there is no static state of "secure". Unlike traditional security approaches that may imply a binary secure/insecure classification, the concept of "securable" acknowledges that security is an ongoing, dynamic process rather than a fixed destination.

Software exists in a constantly evolving threat landscape where new vulnerabilities emerge, attack vectors evolve, business requirements change, and dependencies change. What may be considered secure today could become vulnerable tomorrow due to newly discovered exploits, changes in the threat environment, or modifications to the system itself. This reality necessitates a shift from pursuing an illusory state of perfect security to building software with inherent qualities that enable it to adapt to and withstand evolving threats.

To illustrate the concept of 'securable', consider the analogy of a house: a house that is currently locked represents a static 'secure' state, whereas a house built with strong foundations, high-quality locks, a well-maintained alarm system, and clear lines of sight represents a 'securable' state. Just as a 'securable' house is designed with inherent qualities that allow it to remain secure against evolving threats over time, software should be built with similar qualities to adapt to and withstand new vulnerabilities. FIASSE focuses on embedding these inherent 'securable' qualities into software architecture and code.

The "securable" paradigm emphasizes:

- **Adaptive Resilience**: Software should be designed with the capability to respond to and recover from security events.
- **Evolutionary Security**: Security measures must evolve alongside the software and its operating environment.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Security is an iterative process that requires ongoing attention and refinement.
- **Business Alignment**: Security efforts must align with business objectives and risk tolerance, not pursue security for its own sake.

This approach aligns security practices with the reality of software development, where systems are continuously modified, extended, and deployed in changing environments. Development teams can create systems that maintain their protective qualities even as they evolve instead of becoming brittle and insecure when changed.

### 2.2. Resiliently Add Computing Value

In a business context, the primary directive of software engineering is to create valuable code that is robust enough to withstand change, stress, and attack. This directive can be concisely expressed as: "Resiliently add computing value". This means creating software that not only meets functional requirements but also possesses securable qualities â like Analyzability, Modifiability, and Testability â that allow it to persist its integrity over time regardless of conditions. These qualities enable it to accommodate evolving business needs over time while remaining fortified against threats.

It should be noted that Software Engineering refers to the broader discipline of designing, developing, and maintaining software in a systematic and organized way [Wikipedia-SE]. This underscores the idea that security is not merely a test at the end of the process, but an intrinsic component of well-engineered software. Security contributes directly to a software product's ability to deliver value reliably and sustainably.

### 2.3. Security Mission: Reducing Material Impact

The core mission of cybersecurity, as articulated by Rick Howard in "Cyber Security First Principles," is to "Reduce the probability of material impact of a cyber event". Complete elimination of breaches, while an ideal, is often an impractical business goal. Security strategies MUST, therefore, align with overarching business objectives. This requires a balanced approach. While formal buy-in and metrics are necessary, AppSec's role extends to enabling Development teams to meet security expectations and pass security assessments. This effectively reduces the chance of a successful attack and minimizes potential damage.

### 2.4. Mindset Convergence: Hacker vs. Engineer

The idea that all programmers should prioritize security first, think like attackers, or act as pentesters to eliminate security problems overlooks a critical distinction. While understanding how systems can be compromised is valuable, it does not inherently translate as knowledge of how to build securely. It is unreasonable to expect business value to be secondary to security. There is a significant difference between identifying a vulnerability and implementing a robust, scalable software engineering solution. This highlights the importance of scalable security practices; relying solely on line-level fixes does not scale effectively.

Additionally, the two mindsets do not represent a gap. Instead, they are complementary disciplines: development adding value, which security reduces the risk of losing. Just as we don't talk about the complementary roles of Accounting and Operations as a gap, we should not view the roles of Security and Development in this way. Further, security should not feel the need to disrupt the value-adding operation.

### 2.5. Aligning Security with Development

As mentioned above, true alignment between security and development requires a return to first principles. Instead of imposing security-centric jargon and processes that may slow or disrupt development, FIASSE advocates for using well-established software engineering terms to describe securable code attributes (SSEM properties like Analyzability, Modifiability, Testability, Confidentiality, etc.). This fosters understanding and empowers developers to address security confidently without years of dedicated security experience. The goal is to instill confidence and enable security to recognize these securable attributes in existing code. For example, identifying highly Analyzable code by its clarity and ease of understanding or low Cyclomatic complexity. Then understanding that this attribute plays an important role in accurately identifying security weaknesses, even before they are exploitable. Or by recognizing that Testable code can be altered quickly with high confidence in quality outcomes and that it will remain fortified. Development adds to Security's confidence by understanding what building securable software entails from an engineering perspective. As will be discussed, this also requires specific participation from AppSec professionals in the early stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), particularly during requirements gathering and feature planning.

### 2.6. The Importance of Transparency

Transparency is the principle of designing a system so that its internal state and behavior are observable and understandable to authorized parties. It is a foundational engineering strategy that underpins several core SSEM attributes, enabling trust and simplifying analysis. Transparency is about showing clear, contextualized visibility into how the system operates, makes decisions, and handles data.

Transparency is achieved through deliberate instrumentation and clear auditing capabilities. Depending exclusively on tools for transparency can lead to a reactive posture, as it may not provide the foundational observability needed for proactive system analysis. A transparent system is designed to be observable fundamentally, making it easier to analyze, maintain, and secure.

## 3. The Securable Principle

This is a foundational principle of FIASSE. The Securable Principle shifts the focus from the traditional strategy of repeatedly asking "Is it secure?" to a more nuanced and actionable approach by questioning: "Do we meet our defined goals for this particular securable attribute?" This approach recognizes that security is not a binary state but a spectrum of qualities that can be measured, improved, and maintained over time. There is no static secure state. Instead of focusing on security controls, this principle emphasizes building software with inherent qualities that promote security and protect data. This increases the likelihood of being able to protect against real-world threats over a period of time.

### 3.1. Securable Software Engineering Model Overview

The Securable Software Engineering Model (SSEM) is centered on providing a design language that uses established software engineering terms to define the core attributes that make software "securable" (see Section 2.1). These attributes allow SSEM to abstract security away from specialized jargon or exploit-centric views. For software engineers, this enables them to confidently integrate security considerations as a natural part of their development work. It also helps security professionals identify how existing code meets security expectations and areas for improvement.

A key objective of SSEM as a design language is to shift the conversation regarding software security. Instead of a binary "Is it secure?" assessment, the focus moves to a more nuanced and actionable question: "Do we meet our defined goals for this particular securable attribute?"

SSEM is further designed to:

- Account for the iterative nature of software development and agile methodologies.
- Serve as a mental model, a checklist, or a means to express and set clear expectations for securable design.

Here are the core attributes of SSEM grouped into three primary categories, each representing a fundamental aspect of securable software:

| **Maintainability** | **Trustworthiness** | **Reliability** |
|:-----------------|:-----------------:|--------------:|
| Analyzability    | Confidentiality   | Availability  |
| Modifiability    | Accountability    | Integrity     |
| Testability      | Authenticity      | Resilience    |

SSEM is not a rigid framework but a flexible model that can adapt to various software engineering practices. It emphasizes the inherent qualities of software that contribute directly to security. This allows it to scale effectively without requiring security to adopt toilsome or overly complex processes, which may conflict with the development team's workflow.

### 3.2. Core Securable Attributes

SSEM identifies several fundamental and universal attributes that are the building blocks of securable software in an evolving landscape (as discussed in Section 2.1). These attributes are not merely abstract concepts but represent tangible characteristics that directly contribute to its overall security and resilience. They are grouped into three primary categories: Maintainability, Trustworthiness, and Reliability, each encompassing specific sub-attributes detailed below. By focusing on these, developers can proactively build systems that are easier to secure and keep secure over time.

#### 3.2.1. Maintainability

Definition: Maintainability is the "degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a product or system can be modified by the intended maintainers" (ISO/IEC 25010:2011). In the context of SSEM, this means software can be evolved, corrected, and adapted to new threats or requirements without undue effort or introducing new vulnerabilities. This focus on ease of modification and adaptation is central to building securable software, as it directly supports the ability to respond to the dynamic threat landscape and evolving security needs outlined in Section 2.1. It encompasses the following sub-attributes:

##### 3.2.1.1. Analyzability

Definition: âThe degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which it is possible to assess the impact on a product or system of an intended change to one or more of its parts, or to diagnose a product for deficiencies or causes of failures, or to identify parts to be modifiedâ (ISO 25010, Â§4.2.7.3). This means the ability to find the cause of a behavior within the code. From a security standpoint, code must be understandable to find and fix vulnerabilities. Analyzability directly correlates to the speed and efficiency of vulnerability remediation.

Contributing Factors:

- Volume (Lines of Code - LoC): Overall size of the codebase.
- Duplication: Percentage of duplicated code.
- Unit Size (e.g., mLoC/cLoC): Lines of code per class, method, or block.
- Unit Complexity (e.g., Cyclomatic Complexity): Degree of complexity within a code unit.
- Component Balance: The distribution and size uniformity of top-level components.

##### 3.2.1.2. Modifiability

Definition: âThe degree to which a product or system can be effectively and efficiently modified without introducing defects or degrading existing product qualityâ (ISO 25010, Â§4.2.7.4). This means the ability to modify code without breaking existing functionality or introducing new vulnerabilities.

Contributing Factors:

- Duplication: As above, duplicated code increases the risk of inconsistent changes.
- Unit Complexity: Complex units are harder to modify safely.
- Module Coupling: The number of incoming dependencies for modules; high coupling can lead to cascading changes and unintended consequences.

Modifiability is particularly important for security because it allows for rapid response to newly discovered vulnerabilities or changing security requirements. It enables teams to adapt their codebase without extensive rework, which is crucial in a fast-paced development environment.

##### 3.2.1.3. Testability

Definition: âThe degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which test criteria can be established for a system, product or component and tests can be performed to determine whether those criteria have been metâ (ISO 25010, Â§4.2.7.5). This is the ability to write a test for a piece of code without needing to change the code under test. Effective testing is crucial for verifying security controls and detecting regressions.
Contributing Factors:

- Volume: Larger codebases can be more challenging to test comprehensively.
- Unit Complexity: Complex units are more difficult to test thoroughly.
- Component Independence: The percentage of code in modules with no incoming dependencies from modules in other top-level components; higher independence facilitates isolated testing.
- Unit Coupling: The number of incoming dependencies for units; high coupling can complicate testing by introducing dependencies that must also be tested.
Testability is essential for security; it enables teams to verify that security controls function as intended and that changes do not introduce new vulnerabilities while also supporting the development of automated tests that can run continuously, correlating to the scaling of Security Assurance.

#### 3.2.2. Trustworthiness

Definition: Trustworthiness is "the degree to which a system (including all its components and procedures) can be expected to achieve a set of requirements, such as security requirements" (RFC 4949). A trustworthy system operates within defined levels of trust and meets specified security properties. The FIASSE approach differs from a security-controls-centric view by focusing on the inherent qualities of the code that enable trustworthiness.
Trustworthiness is foundational to securable software, requiring a coordinated effort to ensure that the software consistently achieves its security goals. To achieve this, strong architectural design and style are essential. This includes defining clear trust boundaries and establishing flexible areas of the codebase.
Key attributes contributing to trustworthiness include:

##### 3.2.2.1. Confidentiality

Definition: "The property that data is not disclosed to system entities unless they have been authorized to know the data" (RFC 4949). This ensures that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access.
FIASSE emphasizes confidentiality as a fundamental attribute achieved by designing software with inherent qualities that protect sensitive information, rather than relying solely on overlaid security controls.

##### 3.2.2.2. Accountability

Definition: "The property of a system or system resource that ensures that the actions of a system entity may be traced uniquely to that entity" (RFC 4949). This involves managing principles and access to enable the attribution of actions to specific users or processes, which is crucial for auditing and incident response.
Achieving accountability relies on robust methods for managing principles and their access rights. While it leverages strategies common to non-repudiation, such as comprehensive logging and secure authentication, its core focus is the unique and verifiable attribution of every system action to a specific entity. This is essential for effective auditing and incident response.

##### 3.2.2.3. Authenticity

Definition: "The property that an entity is what it claims to be" (ISO/IEC 27000:2018). This ensures that users, systems, or information are genuine and can be verified. Authenticity is strongly supported by non-repudiation, which is the "ability to prove the occurrence of a claimed event or action and its originating entities" (ISO/IEC 27000:2018). Non-repudiation prevents entities from falsely denying having performed an action or sent a message.
Focusing on authenticity means ensuring that the entities involved in a transaction or communication are who they claim to be; their actions must be irrefutably linked to them. This involves implementing strategies such as:

- Secure authentication methods (e.g., multi-factor authentication).
- Digital signatures and certificates to verify the origin and integrity of data and communications.
- Comprehensive logging and auditing to trace actions back to their origin.

These strategies provide assurance that the entities involved are genuine and accountable for their actions, which is essential for maintaining trust in the system. They also provide transparency to support the maintenance and troubleshooting of the system. Further, transparency complements accountability by ensuring that the mechanisms for tracing actions are clear, and data is accessible to authorized parties.

#### 3.2.3. Reliability

Definition: Reliability is the "degree to which a system, product or component performs specified functions under specified conditions for a specified period of time" (ISO/IEC 25010:2011). In SSEM, this means the software operates consistently and predictably, even under adverse conditions or when facing unexpected inputs or attacks. It includes the following attributes:

##### 3.2.3.1. Availability

Definition: "The property of a system or a system resource being accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized system entity, according to performance specifications for the system" (RFC 4949). This ensures that authorized system entities can access and use the system when needed.

For security, this means that the system is designed to be resilient against attacks like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. It also means that the system can recover quickly from failures or disruptions, ensuring that it remains accessible to authorized users.

##### 3.2.3.2. Integrity

Definition: Encompasses both data integrity, "the property that data has not been changed, destroyed, or lost in an unauthorized or accidental manner," and system integrity, where a system "performs its intended function in an unimpaired manner free from unauthorized manipulation" (RFC 4949). This ensures the accuracy and completeness of data and system operations.

For security, this means implementing measures such as cryptographic hashing, checksums, and access controls to prevent unauthorized modification or corruption of data. Emphasizing this attribute in a fundamental way ensures that the system can be trusted holistically, not just in isolated components.

This approach recognizes that integrity is not just about preventing unauthorized changes. It also ensures that the system operates correctly and consistently, even in the face of potential threats or failures.

##### 3.2.3.3. Resilience

Definition: "The ability of a system to: (a) continue to operate during and after a failure of some part of the system (i.e., provide a degree of fault tolerance); and (b) recover from the failure and restore full operations" (RFC 4949). This also aligns with the concept of an application's ability to continue running predictably, even under unfavorable circumstances or load (as noted in Section 6.4).

Resilience inherently includes fault tolerance, defined as "the ability of a system to continue to operate correctly even though a component has failed" (RFC 4949). This allows the system to withstand partial failures without complete breakdown. Achieving resilience means that fault tolerance is not just an attribute of specific features but is considered for the system as a whole. It involves designing the system to handle errors gracefully, recover from failures, and maintain functionality even when parts of the system are compromised or unavailable.

Strategies for building resilient systems include:

- Coding Defensively: Writing code that anticipates input outside the expected bounds and ignores those inputs rather than failing.
- Predictable code execution: Ensuring that the code behaves consistently under various conditions.
- Strong trust boundaries: Clearly defining areas of the codebase that exert strictly controlled execution.
- Implementing robust error handling and recovery mechanisms to manage partial failures effectively.

### 3.3. Securable Code Strategy

#### 3.3.1. Transparency

Transparency directly strengthens key SSEM attributes and is a fundamental strategy. Achieving transparency requires a foundational design approach rather than relying solely on tooling. It should be achieved through instrumentation capabilities and clear auditing at a code level.

##### 3.3.1.1. Maintainability through Transparency

A transparent system is inherently easier to debug and understand. When developers can clearly trace data flow, state changes, and decision logic through structured logs and metrics, they can diagnose deficiencies and determine the effects of changes with greater speed and accuracy. As a result, this transparency makes the system more maintainable over its lifecycle.

##### 3.3.1.2. Trustworthiness through Transparency

Transparency is the mechanism that makes Accountability possible. To uniquely trace an action to an entity, a clear, immutable, and auditable trail of that action must exist. Likewise, Authenticity is reinforced when authentication and authorization events are transparently logged, allowing for verification and investigation. This verifiable behavior is the bedrock of Trustworthiness.

##### 3.3.1.3. Transparency Tactics

Engineering transparency into a system is an investment that benefits security and operational stability.

- Writing clear, well-documented code is clearly where to start. Use meaningful naming conventions, finite data types, and comments to explain why things work that way.
- Use version control like git to their
- Log events as structured data, including rich context. This makes logs machine-parsable and vastly more useful for analysis, monitoring, and alerting.
- For permission changes, data access, configuration updates, and other security-sensitive events, create detailed and immutable audit trails. The log should capture the "who, what, where, when, and why" of the action.
- A system that manages user roles should log the requesting administrator, the target user, the old role, the new role, and a timestamp, providing an undeniable record for accountability.
- To enhance transparency, expose health and performance metrics through instrumentation. Expose key operational metrics through a standardized API. Metrics like memory or CPU utilization, authentication failures, or input handling error counts. This way, the system provides transparent insight into its real-time behavior.
- Whenever data or control flows across a trust boundary, consider logging useful event information. Include the outcome of any validation, sanitization, or transformation that is outside normal expectations. Optional debug logging of all events can also be useful. Documenting a clear path of execution makes security analysis as well as debugging much easier.

#### 3.3.2. SSEM as a Design Language

By defining these attributes using established software engineering terminology, SSEM provides a common design language. This enables developers to discuss, reason about, and implement security considerations using concepts already familiar to them. It shifts the focus from myopic treatment of vulnerabilities to cohesive creation of software with inherent securable qualities with intention from the design phase on.

This design language plays a crucial role in creating a cohesive product by equipping security to highlight key context-specific considerations.

A design language can bring together a culture of quality made up of diversely inclined professionals to focus on these common goals and ideals. This is achieved by the shift in conversations around security as mentioned in Section 3.1, where the focus is on meeting goals for specific attributes. This contrasts with a find-and-fix monotony that fails to scale. This cultural alignment can strongly influence the product's internal structure to support these technical values.

### 3.4. Measuring SSEM Attributes

Measuring the attributes defined by SSEM is essential to quantify and evaluate the securable qualities of software. This section outlines approaches for measuring each of the core attributes: Maintainability, Trustworthiness, and Reliability. These measurements provide actionable insights to guide developers in enhancing the securability of their software.

#### 3.4.1. Measuring Maintainability

##### 3.4.1.1. Analyzability

- **Quantitative:**
  - **Volume (Lines of Code - LoC):** Tracked per module/system. Lower LoC for a given functionality can indicate better analyzability.
  - **Duplication Percentage:** Measured by static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, PMD). Lower is better.
  - **Unit Size (e.g., mLoC/cLoC):** Average lines of code per method or class. Excessively large units are harder to analyze.
  - **Unit Complexity (e.g., Cyclomatic Complexity):** Measured by static analysis tools. Lower complexity per unit is generally better.

- **Qualitative/Process-based:**
  - **Ease of Writing Tests:** Developer feedback on how easy it is to write meaningful tests for new or existing code.
  - **Test Execution Time:** While not a direct measure of testability, excessively long test suite runs can disincentivize testing.

- **Qualitative/Process-based:**
  - **Audit Log Review Findings:** Results from periodic reviews of audit logs for completeness and usefulness.
  - **Non-repudiation Strength:** An assessment of the strength of evidence linking actions to entities (e.g., use of digital signatures).

##### 3.4.2.3. Authenticity

- **Quantitative:**
  - **Authentication Failures:** The number of failed login attempts (can indicate brute-forcing or issues).
  - **Use of Strong Authentication:** The percentage of authentication points using multi-factor authentication or strong credential types.

- **Qualitative/Process-based:**

  - **Incident Response Plan Effectiveness:** Review of how well the system and team recover from security incidents or operational failures.

## 4. Integrating Security into Development Strategy

### 4.1. Applying SSEM to Dependency Management

SSEM principles are not limited to first-party code; they are equally critical when managing software dependencies. Proactively applying SSEM attributes to the selection, integration, and maintenance of third-party libraries is essential for building securable systems. Detailed practical guidance on dependency management through the lens of SSEM is provided in Section 6.5.

### 4.2. Natively Extending Development Processes

A key principle for reducing friction and effectively preparing development teams is to integrate security into existing development workflows rather than imposing separate, external security gates. This involves understanding and extending current practices.

Security often takes the reviewer seat. While assurance is important to security, it is more impactful to be involved in requirements, architecture, and design. This also avoids an adversarial relationship with people you need to collaborate with. Security positioned as a partner is likely to be better informed and in a better position to provide value.

In addition to a role that extends product and design roles, security can also offer strategic extensions to development activities, including:

- Architecture: Consider business concerns to emphasize security implications. - Architecture: Consider business concerns to emphasize security implications (e.g., throttling and DDoS protection to preserve business integrity).

- Predefined checklists: Develop flexible checklists that incorporate SSEM attributes and security considerations that can be used in various contexts.
- Usability: Framing usability not just as aesthetics but as building trust from a security standpoint (e.g., clear error messages, intuitive permissions management).

### 4.3. The Role of Merge Reviews

While software engineering may lack formal mentoring like other engineering disciplines, the merge review (or pull request review) process serves as a crucial point for guidance, and validation. There are far-reaching benefits to this process. For security, this is where securable code review can scale effectively. It acts as an agile training ground where developers learn from peers and receive feedback in a constructive environment. SSEM attributes can provide a concrete basis for these reviews.

The teams should be careful to avoid introducing unnecessary complexity or friction into the review process. This means the team uses the merge review as guardrails, not as a gate. The goal is to grow the FIASSE mindset within the team, to create a positive experience for the developers.

Code review through merge requests is the single most effective technique for identifying security vulnerabilities early in the development process [OWASP-CRG]. While automated scans can find common or known issues, they often have no way of understanding the context of the change or the architecture of the system. However, the team can quickly identify areas of code that may require more in-depth review through automated scans. Bringing human insight and expertise into the review process ensures that code is less likely to need to be revisited later for quality or security issues.

The collaborative nature of merge reviews allows for the sharing of insight and expertise; they provide a fresh perspective to programmers who may have become too familiar with the code. When FIASSE-trained application security professionals participate, they share valuable insights and expertise with software engineering teams. Over time, this can elevate the overall capability of the team to understand the implications of SSEM attributes, fostering an appreciation for the desired securable results.

It should be noted that teams implementing structured reviews report up to 80% fewer post-release bugs [CodeReviewBenefits].

Merge reviews can also be used as an opportunity to ask 'What can go wrong?' to use threat modeling principles to examine code-level issues that could threaten Trustworthiness and Reliability.Â The simplified scope of a merge review helps to put aside the complexity of a larger system. This sort of targeted approach can make it easier to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities.

In the future, guidance for merge reviews will explore how to effectively integrate SSEM attributes into the review process in detail. It is essential for security professionals to be instructed on how to effectively participate in these reviews, providing value without ignoring basic software engineering principles.

### 4.4. Early Integration: Planning and Requirements

FIASSE advocates for setting expectations at the earliest stages of the development, particularly during planning and requirements definition. This ensures security is a foundational design aspect rather than an afterthought. Fixing vulnerabilities in the design phase costs 100 times less than addressing them in production [VulnCosts]. Detailed methods for integrating security into requirements, such as defining Threat Scenarios and Security Acceptance Criteria, are discussed in Section 6.1.2.

## 5. Addressing Common AppSec Anti-Patterns

### 5.1. The "Shoveling Left" Phenomenon

"Shoveling Left" is defined as the practice of supplying impractical information to developers and leaving the responsibility on them to make sense of it. This anti-pattern often manifests in several ways: how vulnerabilities are reported, how training is conducted, and how testing results are delivered. It can undermine AppSec's credibility and lead to developer disengagement.

#### 5.1.1. Ineffective Vulnerability Reporting

A prime example of "Shoveling Left" is dumping raw findings from security scanning tools directly into the development team's backlog. This approach often lacks context, prioritization, and actionable guidance. While initial progress might be observed, momentum is typically lost, and issues may reappear (the "whack-a-mole" effect). Raw tool output, on its own, is rarely impactful enough to drive sustained improvement.

To avoid this, AppSec should:

1. Focus on True Positives: Validate findings to ensure accuracy.
2. Analyze trends and issue pooling patterns: Look for patterns across multiple findings and tools to identify systemic issues.
3. Identify Root Causes: Address systemic issues rather than just symptoms.
4. Prioritize by Impact: Focus on issues that are plentiful or affect sensitive resources.
5. Collaborate on Solutions: Work with development to formulate wide-impact solutions instead of just line-level mitigations.

6. Verify Fixes: Ensure remediation is effective and consider automated regression tests.

#### 5.1.2. Pitfalls of Exploit-First Training

Security training for developers that primarily emphasizes exploitation techniques ("learn the hack to stop the attack") is another manifestation of "Shoveling Left." As discussed in Section 2.4, understanding how to compromise a system (the 'hacker' mindset) is distinct from knowing how to engineer a robust and securable one (the 'engineer' mindset).

This type of training can be ineffective because it does not equip developers with the engineering principles needed for their daily tasks. Additionally, it fails to teach them how to identify or build code with inherently securable qualities (esp. as defined by SSEM). Consequently, at best, developers might gain a superficial understanding of risks without the practical knowledge to implement effective, systemic preventative measures. This can lead to a false sense of security and does little to foster the proactive, engineering-focused examination of "What can go wrong?". The goal should be better design and implementation instead of line-level mitigations.

### 5.2. Strategic Use of Security Output

While scanning and testing tools are valuable for AppSec to understand the current security posture, their output must be used strategically. It should not be assumed that security requirements are implicit or that developers should be blamed for missing controls if clear expectations were not set. Productive software engineers have a structured workflow designed to deliver value. Any disruption of this workflow can lead to degraded software quality and the flaws that Application Security is trying to prevent.

Therefore, fix requests should never circumvent the processes that software engineers rely on, as this can lead to misunderstandings and mistakes. Bypassing established workflows leads to misunderstandings and mistakes. Therefore, AppSec should not expect developers to act on security findings without clear, actionable information and the opportunity to properly execute their workflow.

## 6. Practical Guidance for Secure Software Development

### 6.1. Establishing Clear Expectations

Clear expectations are foundational to building securable products. AppSec can maximize its impact by setting these expectations effectively. This requires AppSec's alignment with the business processes involved in software development.

#### 6.1.1. Proactive Communication

Basic communication is essential. Development teams should be informed about new testing initiatives or security programs pertaining to the product they maintain. Demonstrating tools to those interested can foster collaboration and identify key contacts for strategic collaboration efforts. Regular synchronization points can help offer support and maintain momentum. Soft skills are important for Application Security professionals to be effective in this role.

#### 6.1.2. Integrating Security into Requirements

Active AppSec participation in formal requirements gathering is crucial. This shifts security from a post-development review or audit to an integral component of the product, aligning it with productivity rather than being perceived as a gate.

Key deliverables can include:

- Security Features: Defining specific security features that must be implemented, such as authentication mechanisms, encryption requirements, or access controls.
- Threat Scenarios: Describing potential misuse cases or attack paths relevant to the feature being developed. This helps identify necessary controls.
- Security Acceptance Criteria: Defining specific, testable conditions that a feature must meet to be considered secure. These criteria allow QA to perform security testing by verifying requirements.

By embedding security into foundational design decisions via requirements, attributes like Trustworthiness, Integrity, and Fault Tolerance are more effectively realized. This approach allows Development teams to address security concerns as part of their standard workflow, making requirements an often underutilized yet powerful tool for security.

### 6.2. Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is a valuable team activity, ideally performed early in the development process. When implementing formal threat modeling, it is important to avoid discouraging more organic approaches to the practice. It is often easier to start threat modeling using a simple framework, such as the "Four Question Framework" (What are we building? What can go wrong? What are we going to do about it? Did we do a good job?). This can highlight areas needing more detailed design or specific security requirements. Threat modeling can be organically integrated with the FIASSE mindset by simply asking "What can go wrong?" at any point in the process. This is sometimes known as "the sneaky method" of threat modeling.

### 6.2.1. Threat Modeling at the Code Level

Asking "What can go wrong?" at the code level can aid in identifying potential issues. When done among pairs of software engineers or with teams it can help junior software engineers develop their sense of taste for good code. Here are some example situations:

- Merge Reviews: Reviewing an entire codebase is impractical because the code is likely to change before the review can be completed. However, it is important to keep up with code changes. And as we all know, earlier is cheaper when it comes to code. For these reasons setting the scope of a code review to the changeset of a merge provides clear context and responsibility.
- Static Analysis: It can be useful to review static analysis (bonus if scoped to a merge request) results with the intent of going deeper by thinking about the impact of a weakness using the Four Question Framework.
- Pair Programming: Encouraging pair programming can facilitate knowledge sharing. It can also help prevent security issues and allow software engineers to get comfortable asking "What can go wrong?"

### 6.2.2. Threat Modeling Solution Framework

Threats follow data. Understanding how data flows through a system is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities. By mapping out data flows, developers can pinpoint where sensitive information is handled and where it might be exposed to threats. Frameworks like STRIDE are useful because they give structure to the process and help us think about 'what can go wrong'.

Previously we may have addressed 'what we are going to do about it' by simply stating the problem in inverse language without considering what that means practically. This may work well for configuration based solutions. Similarly, we could be inclined to think in terms of security controls. In the same way we use frameworks like STRIDE, we can leverage SSEM to bring structure and help us think about what we are going to do about it. Considering the SSEM attributes can lead us to existing architectural or logical solutions that address the threat in a more holistic way. Further, when it is identified that the solution is not an attribute of the system, we understand that it must be addressed through defining or refining security requirements.

### 6.3. Managing Flexibility and Control

A key concept taken from threat modeling is the identification of **trust boundaries**. These are points in the system where data passes between entities with different levels of trust (e.g., user to application, application to database, service to service). Trust boundaries require heightened control over data and process execution. This concept should be allowed to influence implementation best practices, such as strict input handling. This is discussed further in Section 6.4.1.

Software engineers value flexibility in code, as it can facilitate feature implementation and bug fixing. Attackers, however, seek uncontrolled flexibility as a means to force the application to deviate from intended behavior.

The issue is flexibility itself, as it requires appropriate control, especially at trust boundaries. An example of uncontrolled flexibility might be a function capable of executing arbitrary query statements with arbitrary bind parameters without restriction. Control is essential to ensure trustworthy execution, maintain system Integrity, and support Fault Tolerance. While flexibility is necessary for Maintainability.

To enhance security, minimize what is trusted and harden the trust boundaries. Think of trust boundaries like the hard candy shell of a jellybean: the soft, flexible interior represents the bulk of the application's logic. While the hard shell represents the critical points where external data or untrusted operations are carefully controlled so as not to make a sticky mess. Just as the candy shell protects the jellybean's interior from being exposed, well-handled trust boundaries protect the core application from potentially harmful external influences. Defining and communicating these boundaries during the design phase makes it clear which areas of code are responsible for tight control, allowing developers to focus their efforts on maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of these critical interfaces.

One way to allow flexibility while maintaining control is by implementing strict input handling at the trust boundaries. The trust boundary entry point allows the input handling to adapt to the context the value is arriving from. The advantage of this is that it allows the developer to focus on the flexibility of the code without worrying about unexpected input causing unintended behavior. This unexpected behavior could be simple bugs or serious security vulnerabilities. This is covered further in Section 6.4.1.

### 6.4. Resilient Coding and System Resilience

Resilience refers to an application's ability to continue running predictably, even under unfavorable circumstances or load. Tactical resilience is achieved through **defensive coding** practices that promote predictable execution.

This drives developer strategy to focus on the following:

- Strong typing to ensure data is usable in the intended way.
- Filtering and validating all input at trust boundaries. Input validation ensures that data conforms to expected formats, types, lengths, and ranges before processing.
- Properly escaping and encoding all output destined for other systems or interpreters (exiting trust boundaries). This prevents injection attacks by ensuring that data is treated as data, not executable code.
- Sandboxing the use of null values to input checks and database communication. Use exceptions to handle exceptional cases.
- Implement comprehensive and strategic error handling to manage unexpected conditions gracefully, rather than allowing the application to crash or behave unpredictably.
- Using immutable data structures for threaded programming to prevent insecure modification and ensure thread safety and prevent race conditions.

These are verifiable items that AppSec can assess.

#### 6.4.1. Canonical Input Handling

Input handling is a critical aspect of resilient coding. The most basic input handling applies a minimal acceptable range for each parameter at the point of input. This is accomplished through three key practices:

- Canonicalization/Normalization:
  - Ensures that input data conforms to expected formats, types, lengths, and ranges before processing.
  - Prevents unexpected or malicious data from entering the system.
- Sanitization:
  - Cleans input data to remove or neutralize potentially harmful content.
  - Prevents malicious data from being executed or interpreted as code, protecting against injection attacks.
- Validation:
  - Checks that input data meets specific criteria before processing.
  - Ensures that only valid and expected data is processed, reducing the risk of injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
  - Always prefer allowing explicit values instead of rejecting unexpected values.

In some platforms, it may be beneficial to signify that an input value has been fully handled by passing it as a contextualized object rather than a scalar value after validation; if this pattern is desired, ensure it is documented and communicated to the team.

#### 6.4.1.1. The Request Surface Minimization Principle

One tactic for resilient handling of input is to avoid the assumption that the entire request or envelope is intended to be processed. This encourages the programmer to access specific values within the request rather than all values. In some cases, this has allowed developers to avoid certain types of injection attacks, and is generally a good sanitization tactic. This can also work to preserve resilience by simply ignoring values that are out of scope.

A security benefit is that the system can analyze requests for fraud or other attempts at altering the payload without adversely affecting application operation. It should be noted that requests that deviate from expectation should be logged at a minimum or rejected in sensitive situations.

#### 6.4.1.1. The Derived Integrity Principle

A beneficial practice in secure input handling is **The Derived Integrity Principle**. This principle states that any value critical to the integrity of a system's state or business logic **must** be derived or calculated in the trusted server-side context. It should never be accepted directly from a client. This establishes the server as the single source of truth for what is real and authoritative instead of adopting the unknown integrity of the client.

Think of it this way: you would never let a customer walk into a store, pick up an item, and then tell the cashier how much it costs. The price is non-negotiable; it's derived from the store's own trusted system. The same logic must apply to our software.

Applying this principle prevents entire classes of vulnerabilities related to business logic manipulation. The client's role is to express *intent* (e.g., "I want to purchase item X"), not to dictate the *facts* of the transaction (e.g., "and it will cost me $0.01").

Good candidates for this principle include:

- **Pricing and Totals:** The final cost of items in a shopping cart must be calculated on the server based on the product IDs and quantities, referencing a secure price database.
- **User Permissions:** A user's role or permissions level should be loaded from a server-side session or database, not passed in a client request. A user should never be able to tell the system, "I am an administrator."
- **Object State:** The status of an order (e.g., "shipped," "paid") must be managed by an internal state machine, not dictated by a parameter from the client.

Adhering to The Derived Integrity Principle is a direct and powerful application of the SSEM attribute of **Integrity** (Section 3.2.3.2). It ensures that the system performs its intended function in an unimpaired manner, free from the unauthorized manipulation that client-supplied data could introduce.

For example, immagine a user initiates a purchase using some sort of shopping API. They initiate the check out process. The client-side code might send a request like this:

```json
{
  "action": "checkout",
  "items": [
    {
      "itemId": "12345",
      "quantity": 2,
      "price": 5.97
    }
  ]
}
```

Instead of trusting all of the data in this request, the server accepts the clients intent to check out with the items at the given quantities. It starts the checkout process with the item ids that exist in the system at the absolute value of the quantity. At no point in the checkout process does the server accept a price or total from the client.Â It only accepts existing items at a positive quantity. It may even flag a request including a price, logging or perhaps even rejecting it before trying to process it. Fundamentally, the server accepts the intent of the client to purchase the items specified, but does not allow the client to violate the *integrity* of the purchase. It does so by **deriving integrity** from the server side inventory and calculations.

A more advanced example of this principle in action is with JWTs (JSON Web Tokens). If the server accepts any algorithm specified in the JWT for signature verification. This allows the client to dictate the integrity of the token.

### 6.5. Dependency Management

Dependency management starts before a library is introduced to the system. The library should be evaluated for being fit to support your system and its values. This is a key aspect of the FIASSE mindset, which emphasizes the importance of understanding the implications of dependencies on the securable posture of the system.

Applying SSEM principles proactively to dependency selection and management, beyond merely scanning for known vulnerabilities, can be very useful. This involves considering:

- **Analyzability**: Thoroughly understand each dependency's full scope, including its transitive dependencies, its specific purpose within the application, and its potential attack surface. Maintain a clear inventory and a documented rationale for every included dependency.
- **Modifiability**: Design systems with loosely coupled dependencies to facilitate easier updates, patching, or replacement if a vulnerability is discovered, a dependency becomes obsolete, or a more secure alternative is identified. This aligns with architectural modifiability.
- **Testability**: Ensure that dependencies can be effectively managed during testing (e.g., through mocking, stubbing, or version pinning) and that their integration points are themselves robustly testable.
- **Trustworthiness (Authenticity and Integrity)**: Implement processes to verify the source and integrity of dependencies (e.g., using signed packages, checksums, and trusted repositories) before their integration into the codebase.
- **Reliability**: Assess how a dependency's failure modes (e.g., unavailability, performance degradation, security compromise) could impact the overall system's reliability and resilience, and subsequently plan appropriate mitigations.

Not all code that is shared is intended for reuse in systems that need to be resilient. Once FIASSE has been adopted, potential dependencies can be evaluated against the values of the culture it aims to create, ensuring alignment with these SSEM attributes.

Regularly updating software dependencies is a fundamental tactic for maintaining system resilience. Updates often include fixes for known bugs, including security vulnerabilities. This should be a routine process, integrated into sprints or regular maintenance cycles.

Further key considerations for dependency management include:

- Avoid unnecessary dependencies. Each dependency introduces the need for additional maintenance.
- If no direct update fixes a known flaw in a dependency, further analysis is required to identify mitigation strategies (e.g., compensating controls, forking and patching, or reimplementation).
- Organizations should have a clear policy regarding the use and maintenance of open-source dependencies, including processes for addressing vulnerabilities found within them.
- Reliance solely on CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is not sufficient. A thorough analysis of dependencies and their transitive "baggage" is recommended.

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities in SSEM Adoption

Understanding different development roles is useful for tailoring guidance and effectively integrating SSEM.

### 7.0. Security's Role

Security Assurance takes joint responsibility pertaining to the timely delivery of the end result. This ensures the focus of Software Engineers remains on building securable code through a self-governed process that has verified outcomes. Security should provide guidance through participation in development activities like design and requirements gathering. This establishes the guardrails for development to operate as intended. Admittedly, AppSec is not responsible for development's level of adherence to the architecture of the system or feature requirements. Thankfully standard Quality Assurance and User Acceptance processes are in place to ensure that the end result meets the expectations of the business and its users.

Therefore security metrics (those derived from Application Security Testing tools and pentests) are a measure of the effective partnership of security with development, this is not a measure of Software Engineering's adherence to security. The overall security posture of an application reflects how well expectations are set, how well programmers apply best practices and if product allows items to be worked. This is a key distinction that allows security to focus on providing value through requirements, design, and assurance rather than policing or micromanaging development teams looking for line-level fixes.

Low adherence to requirements will also be reflected by results in other types of testing as well. Remember, application security will never outperform quality assurance because quality is a foundation for securable software.

If the posture stays stagnant over time, adjustments to development culture and/or leadership may be necessary. AppSec can encourage culture change by promoting FIASSE and sponsoring activities including continued education. It can be difficult to accept the limits of AppSec's influence, but it is essential to recognize that the responsibility for balancing business value creation with security needs ultimately lies with the development team as a whole.

By spending valuable time in design activities, AppSec can guide a larger number of developers who adhere to the principles of FIASSE. It will also foster a culture of shared responsibility for security, where developers are empowered to take ownership of their code while having the support and guidance of AppSec professionals following established software engineering practices.

### 7.1. Empowering Senior Software Engineers

Experienced, top-tier software engineers are critical to the success of any AppSec program. AppSec professionals should work collaboratively with these engineers in design activities.

Senior engineers should be empowered to:

- Ask, "What can go wrong?" and consider those issues at every stage of development.
- Drive the creation of Security Requirements, Acceptance Criteria, and Threat Scenarios.
- Lead merge reviews, emphasizing SSEM attributes and software engineering principles.

- Champion and schedule regular dependency maintenance.
- Mentor peers as well as less experienced developers.
- Liaise with AppSec teams to ensure smooth security alignment with software engineering practices.

### 7.2. Guiding Developing Software Engineers

Software engineers who are still gaining experience (also known as Jr Programmers, Artisan, or Ancillary Coders) benefit greatly from mental models like SSEM and the methodologies FIASSE describes. They may sometimes struggle to intuitively know "What can go wrong?" but can learn through structured guidance, merge reviews, and pair programming. While following established best practices is a good start, it is important to emphasize the Software Engineering discipline and how the attributes of the SSEM benefit both the programmer and security posture of the system. FIASSE provides the context for why certain practices are important, helping software engineers build a more robust engineering intuition. It helps them build their taste and smell for good and bad code.

These engineers should be encouraged to:

- Focus on becoming strong software engineers.
- Ask for clear Requirements and Acceptance Criteria.
- Be cautious about introducing new external dependencies without due diligence.
- Actively seek code reviews from senior team members to learn and build confidence.
- Write unit tests that cover exceptional conditions and out-of-bounds values.
- Learn and apply defensive coding techniques, particularly input validation and output encoding.
- Be mindful of trust boundaries in the code they write and seek to deeply understand the architecture.
- Seek understanding of FIASSE and SSEM to learn how fundamental principles affect outcomes.

### 7.3. The Role of Product Owners and Managers

Product Owners and Managers play a crucial role in ensuring that FIASSE activities are given enough space in the product development lifecycle. They should:

- Advocate for FIASSE considerations during the planning and prioritization of features.
- Collaborate with AppSec and Development teams to define clear expectations through user stories, threat scenarios, and acceptance criteria.
- Allocate time and resources for:
  - regular software engineering training and awareness programs around FIASSE
  - regular dependency maintenance and evaluation

## 8. Evolution and Adoption of FIASSE

### 8.1. Adapting to Emerging Software Engineering Trends

FIASSE is positioned to evolve alongside emerging trends in software engineering, ensuring that security remains an integral component.

#### 8.1.1. AI-Driven Software Development

The increasing use of AI-powered tools, particularly Generative AI, for code generation, bug detection, code fixes, and automated testing, presents significant opportunities and challenges for software security. While these tools can accelerate development, they also risk propagating insecure coding patterns; without proper guidance, they may generate code that is difficult to analyze, modify, and test securely.

FIASSE is well-suited to address this by providing a framework for Prompt Engineering for Securable Code. This involves crafting prompts for Generative AI tools that explicitly or implicitly request code exhibiting FIASSE's core securable attributes:

- Analyzability in Prompts: Prompts can direct AI to generate code that is well-commented, uses clear and consistent naming conventions, adheres to established coding standards, and possesses a logical, understandable structure. For example, a prompt might specify, "Generate a Python function to parse CSV data, ensuring comprehensive comments for each logical step and adherence to PEP 8 style guidelines."
- Modifiability in Prompts: Prompts can guide AI to produce modular code with low coupling and high cohesion, clear interfaces, and an avoidance of duplicated logic. An example could be, "Develop a Java class for user authentication that is easily extensible for new authentication methods and avoids hardcoding configuration parameters."
- Testability in Prompts: Prompts can request the generation of code that is inherently testable, for instance, by asking for functions with clear inputs and outputs, minimal side effects, and even the co-generation of unit tests. For example, "Write a Go function to calculate X, and include unit tests covering valid inputs, invalid inputs, and edge cases."

Beyond these core attributes, prompts can also incorporate broader security considerations derived from FIASSE's principles:

- Requesting code that implements specific security controls (e.g., "Generate code to sanitize user input for predictable code execution.").
- Include security requirements and FIASSE attributes as part of the Product Requirements Document (prd.md).
- Include FIASSE attributes as part of the Acceptance Criteria Document (acd.md).
- Include FIASSE attributes as part of the code standards for generation (e.g., copilot-instructions.md).

Integrating FIASSE into prompt engineering aims to shift the output of AI code generators towards producing code that is not only functional but also inherently more securable from its inception. This proactive approach complements other AI-enhanced security practices.

#### 8.1.2. Low-Code and No-Code Platforms

As low-code and no-code development platforms become more prevalent, FIASSE principles can be adapted by:

- Establishing security guidelines based on FIASSE and tailored for citizen developers.
- Embedding automated security checks within these platforms.
- Ensuring that pre-built components and templates adhere to SSEM's secure coding principles.

#### 8.1.3. Cloud-Native and Serverless Architectures

The shift towards microservices, containers, and serverless computing necessitates an emphasis within FIASSE on:

- Secure API design to support robust authentication/authorization security requirements.
- Resilient architecture principles to mitigate cloud-specific threats.

#### 8.1.4. Continuous Security Engineering

FIASSE naturally aligns with Continuous Security Engineering philosophies by embedding security into the way software is iteratively developed. Future adaptations will likely further strengthen this alignment through:

- Enhanced guidance on avoiding 'Shovel Left' anti-patterns in security automation.
- Improved actionable security intelligence through observability for real-time monitoring and incident response.
- Continued development of developer-friendly security processes.

#### 8.1.6. AI and Security Governance

With AI playing a larger role in software development, security considerations and robust governance become critical. There are existing OWASP projects focused on AI security that FIASSE may direct readers to for further guidance.

### 8.2. Organizational Adoption Strategies

Adopting FIASSE does not require a structured approach. However, organizations can benefit from a strategic implementation plan to ensure successful integration of FIASSE principles into their software development practices. Here are some recommended steps:

1. **Assess Current Practices:** Evaluate if the organization is open to adopting FIASSE principles and practices. This may involve discussions with key stakeholders and a review of existing workflows.
Â Â - Identify existing security practices and how they align with SSEM attributes.
Â Â - Determine the current level of understanding and acceptance of Software Engineering principles among development teams.
Â Â - Assess the misalignments FIASSE can address.
2. **Integrate SSEM Terminology:** Deliberately incorporate SSEM attributes (Maintainability, Trustworthiness, Reliability) and their sub-attributes into existing developer documentation, coding standards, style guides, and training materials. This helps socialize the concepts and provides a common language for discussing and evaluating securability. This step can be challenging depending on the organization.
3. **Identify Key Influencers:** Identify senior software engineers and other key stakeholders who are able to internalize the framework and the principles. These individuals can champion FIASSE adoption. These individuals should have a strong understanding of software engineering.
4. **Educate and Train Teams:** Provide comprehensive training on FIASSE activities and SSEM attributes to Key Influencers. Introductory training should be role-specific and integrated into onboarding and continuous learning programs.

Â Â - Development and AppSec should understand that FIASSE is meant to be discussed in the context of software engineering, not as a separate security initiative.
Â Â - After the initial training, primary delivery of ongoing training should be delivered in the context of merge reviews, architecture discussions, and requirements gathering. Leaders should be encouraged to bring FIASSE discussions into these activities.

5. **Foster Collaboration:** Promote regular collaboration between AppSec and Development teams. Discourage AppSec from simply reviewing items in isolation; instead, encourage AppSec to engage in Development activities such as requirements gathering.
6. **Continuously Monitor and Improve:** FIASSE is an ongoing process. Implement real-time security observability and use the gathered insights to continuously refine security strategies and FIASSE implementation.

FIASSE is applicable to various organizational types, such as large technology companies integrating it into Continuous Security Engineering, financial institutions enhancing data protection, AI and cloud-based companies designing secure architectures, and open-source projects adopting secure development guidelines.

## 9. Conclusion

Building securable software is not solely the responsibility of individual programmers; it MUST be a natural and integral part of the Software Engineering discipline. FIASSE offers a framework to achieve this by fostering a common understanding between Application Security and Development teams.

FIASSE allows development teams to build securable code confidently and autonomously. This collaborative, developer-centric approach aims to reduce friction, avoid common pitfalls like "Shoveling Left," and ultimately lead to more secure software outcomes that align with business objectives.
