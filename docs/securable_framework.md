# A Framework for Integrating Application Security into Software Engineering (FIASSE)

## Abstract

This document outlines the Framework for Integrating Application Security into Software Engineering (FIASSE), a vendor-independent framework. FIASSE centers on a design language rooted in established software engineering terminology, provided by the Securable Software Engineering Model (SSEM). These attributes define the inherent security characteristics of securable software. The accompanying principles help software engineers reason about architecture and implementation for securable outcomes. Building on the model and principles, FIASSE also includes feedback flow guidance so security findings have the highest impact. This enables development teams to resiliently add computing value while reducing the probability of material impact from cyber events throughout the code's lifespan.  

To be clear about scope, FIASSE is not an assurance framework, maturity model, or replacement for control catalogs or vulnerability metrics. Its purpose is to address how security is implemented in software, connecting engineering decisions directly to securable outcomes and easing downstream pressure on assurance and compliance.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. The Application Security Challenge

Organizations invest significantly in secure coding initiatives and security testing tools, yet often do not observe commensurate improvement in application security (AppSec) outcomes. Tangible progress can feel slow, and friction between AppSec and Development teams is a persistent impediment.

Generative AI tools for code generation have added a new dimension to this challenge. These tools can accelerate development, but they also risk propagating insecure patterns if not guided by sound engineering principles. Ensuring AI-generated code is securable requires the same foundational approach as any other code.

A more fundamental problem also persists: many well-intentioned strategies, including the prevalent "shift left" movement, have produced disappointing results in practice, failing to produce lasting change in the software being built. The failure is not in the timing. Integrating security earlier is sound. The problem is the pattern of delivering training and testing outputs in forms that developers cannot act on within their normal engineering focus. A key question underlies all of these challenges: how can development teams consistently produce securable code without requiring developers to acquire deep security expertise?

### 1.2. Document Purpose and Scope

This document introduces the Framework for Integrating Application Security into Software Engineering (FIASSE, pronounced /feiz/) and its core component, the Securable Software Engineering Model (SSEM, pronounced /si:m/).

FIASSE provides the overarching strategic approach and practices that integrate security into software engineering. SSEM, as a model within FIASSE, offers a common design language (a shared set of terms and concepts that gives a team a common vocabulary for discussing and evaluating a system's qualities) and a set of measurable attributes that guide the creation of securable software, aligning AppSec objectives with business goals.

The term "securable" is used throughout this document as a deliberate choice over "secure." Where "secure" implies a condition that is either achieved or not, "securable" describes software that is built to remain defensible: structured so that it can be understood, changed, tested, and hardened as the world around it changes. Section 2.1 develops this concept in full.

This document covers the following topics:

- Foundational principles underpinning FIASSE and SSEM (Section 2)
- The core attributes of securable software as defined by SSEM (Section 3.2)
- Practical guidance for developers to build securable code (Section 4)
- Strategies for integrating FIASSE into existing development processes (Section 5)
- Common pitfalls in AppSec and how FIASSE addresses them (Section 6)
- The roles of engineering and security personnel in adopting FIASSE (Section 7)
- The evolution of FIASSE in response to emerging trends and strategies for organizational adoption (Section 8)

This document is intended for Software Engineers, Application Security professionals, Product Security Engineers, engineering managers, and anyone involved in software development who seeks to improve application security outcomes. Within security organizations, FIASSE serves as a unifying framework: SSEM supplies the technical language and measurable attributes that support development practices to address security concerns, while the framework's emphasis on business alignment and clear expectations enables security teams to translate strategic objectives into actionable development requirements.

FIASSE is not an assurance framework. It does not measure the maturity of a security program, as maturity models such as BSIMM, OpenSAMM, and NIST SSDF do. It does not replace control catalogs such as NIST 800-53, ISO 27001 Annex A, or PCI DSS; those catalogs describe verification of requirements and protective actions taken largely outside the code under construction, and they retain their proper place in risk management, assurance, and external evaluation. It does not replace vulnerability counts, penetration-test findings, or other assurance metrics which remain valid measurements of the software's current defensive posture. FIASSE operates in cooperation with all of these. Its concern is how security requirements are implemented in the code under construction, how security expertise is applied to that implementation, and how development flow is preserved while security expectations are met. When FIASSE is adopted well, the expected effect is that existing assurance metrics improve. It also results in reduced findings churn, more durable fixes, and faster turnaround.

---

## 2. Foundational Principles

FIASSE is oriented by four core values. Framed in the spirit of the Agile Manifesto, each expresses a relative preference: both sides have worth, but when choices must be made, FIASSE favors the left.

- **Securable Attributes over Security Controls**: prefer the engineering qualities that let a system be built and kept defensible over security controls put in after the fact to make up for weaknesses.
- **Participation over Assessment**: prefer structured engagement between security and development throughout the lifecycle over evaluation performed after the work is done.
- **Engineering First Principles over Security Jargon**: prefer grounding in established software engineering first principles over security-specific jargon or adversarial heuristics.
- **Business Value over Security Activity**: prefer security that sustains the organization's value creation over security pursued as an end in itself.

> **On Terminology: Controls, Features, and Attributes**
>
> The first value warrants a note on vocabulary, because the word "control" carries two distinct meanings that this framework keeps separate.
>
> In software engineering, "control" is an engineering concept (e.g., control flow, version control, boundary control, control theory). In security and assurance vocabulary, "security control" is a risk-and-assurance concept: an administrative, technical, or physical measure cataloged so its presence and effectiveness can be evaluated, typically by parties external to the code creation process.
>
> Both meanings are legitimate in their own domain. FIASSE does not reject security controls as a concept; it locates them where they belong, which is in risk management, assurance, and external evaluation. It uses different vocabulary for the engineering work of building software. When discussing what developers build, FIASSE speaks of "Security Features" (specific capabilities such as authentication mechanisms; see Section 4.1.2), "Securable Attributes" (the SSEM qualities defined in Section 3.2), and Security "Acceptance Criteria" (testable conditions a feature must satisfy).
>
> The distinction matters because external security controls do not, on their own, make software secure. They measure and constrain; they do not construct. The qualities that make software defensible live in the code itself, and those qualities are what SSEM names. The first value is a statement about where engineering attention is best invested, not a dismissal of the assurance vocabulary that risk and audit functions correctly use.

The sections that follow develop these values as the foundational principles of FIASSE.

### 2.1. The Securable Paradigm: No Static Secure State

The term "securable" reflects a fundamental reality: there is no static state of "secure." A system declared secure today may be vulnerable tomorrow because of a newly discovered exploit, a dependency update, a configuration change, or a shift in the threat environment. Security is not a property a system permanently possesses; it is a capacity the system must be designed to sustain. The securable paradigm recognizes this and redirects the engineering goal accordingly: rather than asking "is it secure?", teams ask "is it built so that security can be maintained?"

Software exists in a continuously evolving threat landscape. New vulnerabilities emerge, attack vectors shift, business requirements change, and dependencies are updated. What is adequate today may be insufficient tomorrow. This reality requires a shift away from pursuing an illusory state of perfect security and toward building software with inherent qualities that allow it to adapt to and withstand evolving threats.

The securable paradigm emphasizes three organizing ideas:

- **Adaptive Resilience**: Software should be designed with the capability to respond to and recover from security events.
- **Evolutionary Security**: Security measures must evolve alongside the software and its operating environment.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Security is an iterative process that requires ongoing attention and refinement.

All three are governed by **Business Value over Security Activity** (Section 2): adaptive resilience, evolutionary security, and continuous improvement are judged by how well they sustain the organization's value creation, not by how much security activity they generate.

Development teams that internalize this paradigm build systems capable of maintaining their protective qualities as the system evolves, rather than becoming brittle and insecure over time.

Authentication illustrates this paradigm applied to a specific system mechanism. An authentication system evaluated as "secure" today may be inadequate tomorrow as credential attack techniques mature, MFA bypass methods emerge, or identity standards change. What matters is whether its architecture allows the team to sustain its integrity over time. The question shifts from "Is our authentication secure?" to "Is our authentication built so that security can be maintained?"

### 2.2. Resiliently Add Computing Value

In a business context, the primary directive of software engineering is expressed in this framework as: **resiliently add computing value.** Each word is load-bearing. *Computing value* is the useful capability the software delivers; it is the reason the business funds its construction. *Add* reflects that delivery is continuous: value accrues change by change, not release by release. *Resiliently* is the constraint on how: each change must leave the system able to withstand the change, stress, and attack that will follow it.

The directive excludes two familiar failure modes. Value added without resilience is capability the business will lose later, with interest, when the system cannot absorb the next threat or requirement. Resilience pursued without adding value is security as an end in itself, which **Business Value over Security Activity** rejects. Software that meets functional requirements while sustaining its securable qualities (Analyzability, Modifiability, and Testability among them) satisfies both halves of the directive.

Software Engineering is the broader discipline of designing, developing, and maintaining software in a systematic and organized way [ISO-24765]. Security is not a test appended at the end of this process; it is an intrinsic component of well-engineered software that contributes directly to a product's ability to deliver value reliably and sustainably.

### 2.3. Security Mission: Reducing Material Impact

The core mission of cybersecurity, as articulated by Rick Howard in "Cybersecurity First Principles," is to "reduce the probability of material impact of a cyber event" [Howard]. Complete elimination of breaches is not a practical business goal. Security strategies must therefore align with overarching business objectives through a balanced approach.

AppSec's role extends beyond formal buy-in and metrics: it encompasses enabling Development teams to meet security expectations and pass security assessments. This reduces the likelihood of a successful attack and limits potential damage when incidents occur.

### 2.4. The Quality-Security Relationship

Security cannot exceed software quality [McGraw2006]. The relationship is now codified in measurement standards: ISO/IEC 5055 defines security as one of four structural quality characteristics measurable directly from source code, alongside reliability, performance efficiency, and maintainability [ISO-5055]. The qualities that make software easy to understand, change, test, and observe are the same qualities that make it possible to secure, and empirical studies show the same code properties predict where vulnerabilities occur [Shin2011]. Where those qualities are absent, security expertise runs into a hard ceiling: vulnerabilities cannot be located efficiently, fixes introduce new defects, testing cannot confirm the fix holds, and the system's behavior under attack cannot be observed with enough fidelity to respond. Every security intervention downstream of the code (scanning, review, testing, incident response) is bounded by what the code itself makes possible.

The ceiling claim is scoped to the code. Some threats never touch the codebase: stolen credentials and social engineering are governed by other disciplines, and no engineering quality prevents them. Configuration sits partly inside the scope. The code determines what must be configured, what the defaults are, and how comprehensible the options remain [Yin2011][Green2016], so carefully constructed software narrows the surface on which misconfiguration can occur and fails safe when it does [Saltzer1975][CISA-SbD2023]. Within that scope, the ceiling is definitive. Unmaintainable code cannot be analyzed, cannot absorb a fix, and cannot verify one. It is not securable at any level of downstream effort, and there is no static state of secure for it to fall back on.

This has two consequences for how security is applied. First, investment in engineering quality is a security investment [Krasner2022]. The return is not immediate but it compounds because every subsequent security activity operates on a better substrate. Second, security teams working against low-quality code will produce disappointing results regardless of tooling, expertise, or effort. The ceiling is set by the code, not by the security function. Section 7.1 returns to this point when discussing the security team's role and its limits.

### 2.5. Aligning Security with Development

A common misconception frames the gap between Security and Development as inherently problematic. The two disciplines are complementary, not adversarial: development adds value, and security works to reduce the risk of losing that value. The analogy to Accounting and Operations is apt: both serve the business from distinct vantage points without one disrupting the other's core function. Security should not need to disrupt the value-adding operation.

True alignment between security and development requires a return to first principles. This is the value of **Engineering First Principles over Security Jargon**. Rather than imposing security-centric jargon and processes that may slow or interrupt development, FIASSE uses well-established software engineering terms to describe securable code attributes. The SSEM properties, including Analyzability, Modifiability, Testability, and Confidentiality, are concepts developers already work with. Using this shared vocabulary fosters understanding and empowers engineers to address security considerations with confidence, without requiring years of dedicated security experience.

This also requires that the expectation of mindset is calibrated correctly. The idea that all programmers should think like attackers or act as penetration testers to eliminate security problems overlooks a critical distinction: understanding how systems can be compromised is not the same as knowing how to build them to be secured. It is not reasonable for business value creation to be secondary to security. There is a significant difference between identifying a vulnerability and implementing a robust, scalable engineering solution to address it. Relying solely on an adversarial mindset does not scale.

Alignment requires specific participation from AppSec professionals early in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), particularly during requirements gathering and feature planning. When security engages at those stages, developers gain the context and expectations they need to build securable software as a natural part of their workflow. This is the value of **Participation over Assessment**: shaping the system as it is being built is more effective than evaluating it after the fact, and it lets security expertise act where it produces the most leverage.

The upstream engagement produces effects that are visible in the downstream assurance metrics leadership already tracks. Requirements that describe security expectations explicitly, implemented consistently across a change, yield lower findings. It also creates fixes that stay fixed, and consistent turnaround from finding to durable remediation. FIASSE does not ask leadership to replace metrics. It indicates that the metrics be downstream indicators of upstream health. When findings recur, fixes regress, or turnaround stalls, the cause is typically in the requirements or the engineering practice, not in the security testing that surfaced them.

### 2.6. The Transparency Principle

Transparency is the principle of designing a system so that its internal state and behavior are observable and understandable to authorized parties. It is a foundational engineering strategy that underpins several core SSEM attributes, enabling trust and simplifying analysis. Transparency is about providing clear, contextualized visibility into how the system operates, makes decisions, and handles data.

Relying exclusively on external tooling for transparency produces a reactive posture. A system that is transparent by design, through structured logging, instrumentation, and clear audit trails, is easier to analyze, maintain, and secure from the outset.

Each SSEM attribute is demonstrated through transparency in some form. Note that transparency operates within the bound set by Confidentiality: visibility is extended only to authorized parties.

#### 2.6.1. Transparency and Maintainability

A transparent system is easier to debug and understand. When developers can trace data flow, state changes, and decision logic through structured logs and metrics, they can diagnose deficiencies and assess the effects of changes with greater speed and accuracy. This directly supports the system's maintainability across its lifecycle.

#### 2.6.2. Transparency and Trustworthiness

Transparency is the mechanism that makes Accountability possible. To uniquely trace an action to an entity, a clear, immutable, and auditable trail of that action must exist. Authenticity is similarly reinforced when authentication and authorization events are transparently logged, enabling verification and investigation. This verifiable behavior is the foundation of Trustworthiness.

#### 2.6.3. Transparency Tactics

Engineering transparency into a system is an investment that benefits both security and operational stability. Practical tactics include:

- Write clear, well-documented code. Use meaningful naming conventions, precise data types, and comments that explain intent rather than just mechanics.
- Use version control (e.g., git) to provide an auditable history of modifications.
- Log events as structured data with rich context. Structured logs are machine-parsable and substantially more useful for analysis, monitoring, and alerting.
- For permission changes, data access, configuration updates, and other security-sensitive events, produce detailed and immutable audit trails. Capture the who, what, where, when, and why of each action. For example, a system that manages user roles should log the requesting administrator, the target user, the prior role, the new role, and a timestamp.
- Expose health and performance metrics through instrumentation. Key operational signals such as authentication failures, input handling error counts, and memory and CPU utilization provide real-time insight into system behavior through a standardized API.
- Log events at trust boundaries. Include the outcome of validation, sanitization, or transformation steps outside normal expectations. Debug-level logging of all boundary events is useful during development and incident analysis.

Transparency and the Principle of Least Astonishment (Section 2.7) work in concert: transparent systems tend to be astonishment-free because their operations are visible and understandable. Together, these properties reduce cognitive load on maintenance teams and increase the speed at which security concerns can be identified and addressed.

### 2.7. The Principle of Least Astonishment

The Principle of Least Astonishment (POLA) holds that systems should behave in ways that are intuitive and predictable to users, developers, and administrators. POLA descends from the classic design principle of psychological acceptability [Saltzer1975]. When a system diverges from reasonable expectations through unexpected behavior, hidden side effects, or unintuitive interfaces, it becomes harder to understand, reason about, and secure.

POLA is particularly relevant to securable software for three reasons:

- **Predictability aids analysis.** When code behaves as expected, developers can identify problems faster, making the system more Analyzable.
- **Reduced cognitive burden.** Unexpected behavior introduces complexity that developers must track mentally. Eliminating surprise reduces that burden and supports Modifiability.
- **Intuitive security boundaries.** Clear separation of concerns and trust boundaries makes it easier for developers to understand where security controls are needed and why.

In practice, POLA manifests as:

- Consistent naming and behavior across the codebase
- Functions and methods that do what their names indicate, without hidden side effects
- Clear, documented exceptions to expected behavior
- Predictable error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Interfaces that behave as users would naturally expect

Adhering to POLA during design and implementation produces systems that are more securable, maintainable, and trustworthy over time.

## 3. The Securable Software Engineering Model (SSEM)

### 3.1. Model Overview and Design Language

Section 2.5 established that true alignment between security and development requires shared vocabulary: security-centric jargon imposed on engineers creates friction, while terms already native to software engineering create common ground. SSEM is the practical expression of that principle. It provides a design language built from established software engineering terms to define the attributes that make software securable (see Section 2.1). Where Section 2.5 identifies the need and Section 2.1 explains why securability matters as a concept, SSEM makes both operational: each attribute is something a team can define goals for, measure against, and improve incrementally. By grounding security attributes in familiar engineering vocabulary, SSEM allows software engineers to integrate security considerations as a natural part of their development work, and enables security professionals to evaluate how existing code meets security expectations and where improvement is warranted.

The central shift SSEM enables is a change in the question asked during security assessment. Rather than a binary "Is it secure?" evaluation, the focus becomes: "Do we meet our defined goals for this particular securable attribute?" This framing is actionable, measurable, and compatible with iterative development.

SSEM is designed to:

- Account for the iterative nature of software development and agile methodologies.
- Serve as a mental model, a checklist, or a vehicle for expressing and setting clear expectations for securable design.
- Shift conversations away from find-and-fix monotony toward cohesive, intention-driven creation of software with inherent securable qualities.

This is the value of **Securable Attributes over Security Controls** made operational. Rather than enumerating controls for auditors to verify at a point in time, SSEM defines the engineering qualities that allow a system to be secured, measured, and improved as it evolves.

The attributes are organized into three primary categories:

| **Maintainability** | **Trustworthiness** | **Reliability** |
|:--------------------|:-------------------:|----------------:|
| Analyzability       | Confidentiality     | Availability    |

SSEM is not a rigid framework. It is a flexible model that adapts to various software engineering practices and emphasizes inherent qualities of software that contribute directly to security. This allows it to scale without requiring security to adopt complex processes that may conflict with development workflows.

By defining these attributes in engineering terms, SSEM creates a common design language. It equips security professionals to surface context-specific considerations, and it provides developers with the conceptual tools to discuss and reason about security using vocabulary already familiar to them. A shared design language can bring together a culture of quality across diversely skilled teams, focused on common goals rather than isolated compliance checkboxes. This cultural alignment directly influences a product's internal structure to reflect these technical values.

### 3.2. Core Securable Attributes

The following attributes are the building blocks of securable software. They are not abstract concepts; each represents a tangible characteristic that contributes directly to a system's overall security and resilience. By building toward these attributes, developers proactively construct systems that are easier to secure and protect as the threat landscape evolves.

#### 3.2.1. Maintainability

**Definition:** "The degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a product or system can be modified by the intended maintainers" [ISO-25010]. In the context of SSEM, Maintainability means software can be evolved, corrected, and adapted to new threats or requirements without undue effort or the introduction of new vulnerabilities. This focus on ease of modification is central to securable software, as it directly supports the ability to respond to the dynamic threat landscape described in Section 2.1.

##### 3.2.1.1. Analyzability

**Definition:** "The degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which it is possible to assess the impact on a product or system of an intended change to one or more of its parts, or to diagnose a product for deficiencies or causes of failures, or to identify parts to be modified" [ISO-25010, §4.2.7.3]. In practical terms, Analyzability is the ability to locate the cause of a behavior within the code. Code must be understandable to find and fix vulnerabilities; Analyzability directly determines the speed and accuracy of vulnerability remediation.

Contributing factors [Heitlager2007]:

- **Volume (Lines of Code):** Overall size of the codebase.
- **Duplication:** Percentage of duplicated code.
- **Unit Size** (e.g., method Lines of Code / class Lines of Code): Lines of code per class, method, or block.
- **Unit Complexity (e.g., Cyclomatic Complexity):** Degree of complexity within a code unit.
- **Component Balance:** Distribution and size uniformity of top-level components.

##### 3.2.1.2. Modifiability

**Definition:** "The degree to which a product or system can be effectively and efficiently modified without introducing defects or degrading existing product quality" [ISO-25010, §4.2.7.4]. Modifiability is the ability to change code without breaking existing functionality or introducing new vulnerabilities.

Contributing factors:

- **Duplication:** Duplicated code increases the risk of inconsistent changes.
- **Unit Complexity:** Complex units are harder to modify safely.
- **Module Coupling:** The number of incoming dependencies for modules; high coupling can produce cascading changes and unintended consequences.

Modifiability is particularly important for security because it enables rapid response to newly discovered vulnerabilities or changing security requirements without extensive rework.

##### 3.2.1.3. Testability

**Definition:** "The degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which test criteria can be established for a system, product or component and tests can be performed to determine whether those criteria have been met" [ISO-25010, §4.2.7.5]. Testability is the ability to write a test for a piece of code without modifying the code under test.

Contributing factors:

- **Volume:** Larger codebases are more challenging to test comprehensively.
- **Unit Complexity:** Complex units are more difficult to test thoroughly.
- **Component Independence:** The percentage of code in modules with no incoming dependencies from other top-level components; higher independence facilitates isolated testing.
- **Unit Coupling:** High coupling complicates testing by introducing dependencies that must also be exercised.

Testability enables teams to verify that security controls function as intended and that changes do not introduce new vulnerabilities. It also supports automated testing that runs continuously, directly scaling the reach of security assurance.

##### 3.2.1.4. Observability

Observability is the degree to which the internal state of a system can be inferred from its external outputs. The concept originates in Kálmán's 1960 control theory formalization [Kalman1960] and has been adapted in software engineering to encompass runtime signals. Observability is essential for security: it allows developers and security professionals to understand how the system behaves in real time, and it ensures that users and operators can comprehend the system's state and actions.

Implementing Observability involves:

- Comprehensive logging
- Monitoring
- Instrumentation
- User interface (UI) feedback mechanisms

Observability must be achieved through instrumentation and auditing built into the code itself rather than through external tooling alone. Tooling can surface signals, but it can only surface what the code exposes. A system that is not instrumented at the code level is opaque by construction, and no amount of external scanning compensates for that. Each SSEM attribute is demonstrable through observable behavior in some form: Analyzability through structured logs that make state and data flow traceable, Accountability through immutable audit trails, Authenticity through logged authentication events, and Resilience through error and recovery telemetry.

#### 3.2.2. Trustworthiness

**Definition:** "Ability to meet stakeholder expectations in a verifiable way" [ISO-5723]. A trustworthy system operates within defined levels of trust and meets specified security properties in a manner that can be demonstrated rather than assumed. Rather than focusing on overlaid security controls, FIASSE emphasizes the inherent code qualities that enable trustworthiness: strong architectural design, clear trust boundaries, and well-defined areas of flexibility.

Key attributes contributing to trustworthiness include:

##### 3.2.2.1. Confidentiality

**Definition:** "Property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes" [ISO-27000, §3.10]. Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access, whether that information is at rest, in transit, or in active use within the system.

FIASSE treats Confidentiality as an attribute achieved through the construction of software with inherent protective qualities, rather than through overlaid controls alone.

##### 3.2.2.2. Accountability

**Definition:** The property that every action taken within a system can be attributed to a specific, identified entity. Accountability involves managing principals and access rights in a way that enables attribution of actions to specific users or processes. This attribution is essential for auditing and incident response.

Achieving Accountability requires robust methods for managing principals and their access rights. While it draws on strategies common to non-repudiation, including comprehensive logging and robust authentication, its core focus is the unique and verifiable attribution of every system action to a specific entity.

##### 3.2.2.3. Authenticity

**Definition:** "The property that an entity is what it claims to be" [ISO-27000]. Authenticity ensures that users, systems, or information are genuine and verifiable. It is strongly supported by non-repudiation: "the ability to prove the occurrence of a claimed event or action and its originating entities" [ISO-27000], which prevents entities from falsely denying having performed an action or sent a message.

Implementing Authenticity involves:

- Authentication mechanisms designed for sustained defense: credential and token lifecycles that support rotation, expiry, and revocation; telemetry sufficient to recognize attack patterns such as credential stuffing; and designed response paths for when a factor is circumvented, including step-up challenges, forced re-authentication, and factor retirement.
- Digital signatures and certificates to verify the origin and integrity of data and communications.
- Comprehensive logging and auditing to trace actions back to their origin.

These mechanisms provide assurance that entities are genuine and accountable for their actions.

> **On Authorization**
>
> SSEM has no Authorization attribute by design. Authorization is not a property that code can simply have; it is a security feature. It exists only where the operating context demands it, since single-user software has nothing to authorize, and like any other feature it must be gathered as a requirement, shaped in architecture and design, and implemented against acceptance criteria (Section 4.1.2). Expecting it to be present without having specified it is the control-as-requirement fallacy examined in Section 6.1.1. That section's worked example, AC-3, is precisely an authorization control translated into an implementable requirement. What SSEM supplies is everything a sound authorization feature depends on to stay defensible: Authenticity establishes who the actor is, Confidentiality and Integrity bound what may be seen and changed, and Accountability makes each authorization decision traceable. The feature is contextual; the attributes that make it securable are not.

#### 3.2.3. Reliability

**Definition:** "The degree to which a system, product or component performs specified functions under specified conditions for a specified period of time" [ISO-25010]. In SSEM, Reliability means software operates consistently and predictably, even under adverse conditions or when facing unexpected inputs or attacks.

##### 3.2.3.1. Availability

**Definition:** "Property of being accessible and usable on demand by an authorized entity" [ISO-27000, §3.7]. Availability also includes maintaining this performance during periods of adverse circumstances.

For security, Availability means the system is designed to resist attacks like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and to recover quickly from failures or disruptions, ensuring it remains accessible to authorized users.

##### 3.2.3.2. Integrity

**Definition:** "Property of accuracy and completeness" [ISO-27000, §3.36]. In SSEM, Integrity applies at two levels. **System integrity** is the property that the system performs its intended function in an unimpaired manner, free from unauthorized manipulation of its code, configuration, or runtime behavior. **Data integrity** is the property that data has not been changed, destroyed, or lost through unauthorized action, accidental modification, or transmission error.

Implementing Integrity involves measures such as cryptographic hashing, checksums, and access controls to prevent unauthorized modification or corruption. Emphasizing Integrity at a fundamental level ensures that trust in the system extends to all its components, not just isolated parts. Integrity encompasses more than preventing unauthorized changes; it also ensures the system operates correctly and consistently in the face of potential threats or failures.

##### 3.2.3.3. Resilience

**Definition:** The ability of a system to continue operating during and after the failure of one or more of its parts, and to recover from that failure and restore full operations. Resilience also encompasses an application's ability to continue running predictably under unfavorable circumstances or load (as discussed in Section 4.4).

Resilience includes fault tolerance: the ability of a system to continue operating correctly even when a component has failed. Achieving Resilience means fault tolerance is designed into the system as a whole, not bolted onto specific features. The system handles errors gracefully, recovers from failures, and maintains functionality even when components are compromised or unavailable.

Strategies for building resilient systems include:

- **Defensive coding:** Writing code that anticipates input outside expected bounds and handles it without failing.
- **Predictable execution:** Ensuring code behaves consistently under varied conditions.
- **Strong trust boundaries:** Clearly defining areas of the codebase that enforce strictly controlled execution.
- **Robust error handling:** Implementing recovery mechanisms that manage partial failures effectively.

## 4. Practical Guidance for Securable Software Development

### 4.1. Establishing Clear Expectations

Clear expectations are foundational to building securable products. AppSec maximizes its impact by setting those expectations early and in terms that integrate naturally into development workflows. This requires alignment with the business processes involved in producing software.

#### 4.1.1. Proactive Communication

Development teams should hear about new testing initiatives and security programs affecting their products from the security team directly, before the first findings arrive. Demonstrating a new tool to the engineers who will live with its output builds collaboration and surfaces the key contacts that partnership depends on; regular synchronization points then keep that support visible and the momentum real. For AppSec professionals working this way, communication is not a soft skill layered onto the role. It is how the role functions.

#### 4.1.2. Integrating Security into Requirements

Active AppSec participation in formal requirements gathering moves security from a post-development review to an integral component of the product, aligning it with productivity rather than positioning it as a gate.

Key deliverables include:

- **Security Features:** Specific security capabilities that must be implemented, such as authentication mechanisms, encryption requirements, or access controls.
- **Threat Scenarios:** Descriptions of potential misuse cases or attack paths relevant to the feature being developed, used to identify necessary controls.
- **Security Acceptance Criteria:** Specific, testable conditions a feature must satisfy to be considered secure. These criteria allow QA to perform security testing by verifying requirements. Implementation completeness against defined acceptance criteria is a measurable security outcome: a feature that satisfies all its security criteria provides a verifiable basis for confidence that is absent when criteria were never defined.

Embedding security into foundational design decisions through requirements makes attributes like Trustworthiness, Integrity, and Resilience more reliably realized. Development teams can address security concerns as part of their standard workflow, making requirements an often underutilized but powerful tool for security.

Incomplete requirements are the dominant root cause of security gaps in application code. Decades of AppSec practitioner observation indicate that the great majority of application vulnerabilities trace to either security expectations that were never specified, or specified expectations that were implemented inconsistently across a change. Where security expectations are absent from the requirements that developers work from, the resulting implementation is not deficient by error, it is deficient by design. The gap exists not because developers failed to secure the code, but because no one specified what secure looked like for that feature.

Not every vulnerability class traces to requirements. The common and consequential injection classes sit outside that case, as do supply-chain compromises in which a trusted dependency later betrays that trust, cryptographic protocol weaknesses that emerge over time, and truly novel flaws that only comprehensive testing can surface. FIASSE addresses these residuals through other means: Resilience (Section 3.2.3.3) for graceful behavior in the face of the unexpected, Dependency Stewardship (Section 4.6) for the ongoing trust relationship with third-party code, and Observability (Section 3.2.1.4) for detecting the anomalous behavior that novel classes tend to produce before they are named.

### 4.2. Threat Modeling

This section addresses two related but distinct activities: **Threat Modeling**, a formal structured analysis conducted at the system or feature level; and **Threat Awareness**, a continuous, lightweight practice applied at the code level. They serve different purposes and operate at different scopes. Conflating them risks overstating informal inquiry or, more commonly, creating the impression that a formal exercise has already been done when it has not.

**Threat Modeling** is conducted against a defined methodology, involves a cross-functional group of participants, and produces documented outputs. A complete threat modeling exercise produces a threat model: a recorded analysis of what the system is built to do, what assets it protects, what adversaries and attack paths are relevant, and what controls or design decisions address each identified threat. Methodologies such as STRIDE [STRIDE], PASTA [PASTA], and LINDDUN [LINDDUN] provide systematic frameworks for this analysis. The outputs feed directly into security requirements, architecture decisions, and acceptance criteria. Threat modeling requires dedicated time, the right participants (typically a developer, an architect, and a security professional), and a scope bounded enough to be tractable. It is most effective at the architecture and feature design stage, before implementation begins.

**Threat Awareness** is the lightweight, continuous practice of asking "What can go wrong?" at the code level, without the formality, scope, or methodology of threat modeling. It requires no formal process and is valuable precisely because it is immediate and incremental. The Four Question Framework [TM-Manifesto] (*What are we building? What can go wrong? What are we going to do about it? Did we do a good job?*) supports this practice. Threat awareness complements formal threat modeling; it does not substitute for it. Findings that reveal design-level concerns should be escalated into the formal threat model. A team relying on threat awareness alone will catch code-level issues but miss the design-level threats that only a scoped, methodical analysis can surface.

#### 4.2.1. Code-Level Threat Awareness

Asking "What can go wrong?" at the code level helps identify potential issues before they reach production. When practiced in pairs or small teams, it also helps junior engineers develop judgment about code quality. Practical contexts for code-level threat awareness include:

- **Merge Reviews:** Reviewing an entire codebase is not practical because the code continues to change. Scoping a review to the changeset of a merge provides clear context and responsibility. Earlier is less costly, and merge reviews make earlier the default.
- **Static Analysis:** Reviewing static analysis results, particularly when scoped to a merge request, with the intent of going deeper using the Four Question Framework can surface impact that automated tools alone would not flag.
- **Pair Programming:** Pair programming facilitates knowledge sharing, helps prevent security issues early, and builds comfort with the "What can go wrong?" question.

Code-level threat findings should feed back into the broader Threat Model so that threats can be assessed from a design perspective. This can surface design-level solutions that are more maintainable and scale better than localized fixes.

#### 4.2.2. Threat Modeling Solution Framework

Threats follow data. Understanding how data flows through a system is central to identifying potential vulnerabilities. Mapping data flows allows developers to pinpoint where sensitive information is handled and where it may be exposed to threats. Frameworks like STRIDE [STRIDE] are useful because they provide structure and direct attention toward categories of attack.

When addressing the question "What are we going to do about it?", the default is sometimes to state the problem in inverse language or to reach for a security control. SSEM provides a more structured alternative. Considering the SSEM attributes, particularly Trustworthiness and Reliability, can lead to existing architectural or logical solutions that address a threat more holistically. Further, when it becomes clear that a threat cannot be addressed through an inherent system attribute, that recognition defines a requirement: the gap must be addressed through explicit security requirements.

### 4.3. The Boundary Control Principle

> Control in this section refers to its software-engineering sense: the regulated handling of data and execution flow at a trust boundary, not a "security control" in the risk-and-assurance sense addressed in the terminology note in Section 2.

The Boundary Control Principle holds that flexibility within a system's interior is an engineering asset to be preserved, while control at every trust boundary is a security requirement to be enforced. These objectives are complementary, not competing: uncontrolled flexibility at a trust boundary is an attack surface; controlled flexibility throughout the interior is what makes a system maintainable. The principle directs engineers to locate control precisely at the points where trust changes, and to preserve flexibility everywhere else.

A key concept from threat modeling is the identification of trust boundaries: points in the system where data passes between entities with different levels of trust (user to application, application to database, service to service). Trust boundaries require heightened control over data and process execution.

Software engineers value flexibility in code because it facilitates feature implementation and bug fixing. Attackers seek uncontrolled flexibility as a means to force the application to deviate from intended behavior. The issue is not flexibility itself, but the exposure of flexibility through insufficient handling of trust boundaries. An example of uncontrolled flexibility is a function that executes arbitrary query statements with arbitrary bind parameters without restriction. Control is what ensures trustworthy execution, maintains system Integrity, and supports Resilience. Flexibility supports Maintainability. Both are necessary, and neither should come at the expense of the other.

To enhance security, minimize what is trusted and harden trust boundaries. Think of trust boundaries as the hard shell of a turtle: the flexible interior represents the bulk of the application's logic, while the shell represents the critical points where external data and untrusted operations are carefully controlled. Defining and communicating these boundaries during the design phase clarifies which areas of code are responsible for tight control, allowing developers to focus their efforts on maintaining the Integrity and Trustworthiness of those critical interfaces. Data Flow Diagrams are a practical tool for identifying these boundaries.

One approach to maintaining flexibility while preserving control is strict input handling at trust boundaries, producing canonical values. The boundary entry point adapts input handling to the context from which a value is arriving. This allows developers to work flexibly within the system while knowing that unexpected input cannot propagate uncontrolled into core logic. Section 4.4.1 covers this in detail.

### 4.4. Resilient Coding

Resilience refers to an application's ability to continue running predictably, even under unfavorable circumstances or load. At the code level, this is achieved through defensive coding practices that enforce predictable execution.

Practical defensive coding focuses on:

- **Strong typing:** Ensuring data is usable in the intended way.
- **Input validation at trust boundaries:** Confirming data conforms to expected formats, types, lengths, and ranges before processing.
- **Output encoding:** Properly escaping and encoding all output destined for other systems or interpreters, preventing injection attacks by ensuring data is treated as data rather than executable instructions.
- **Null value handling:** Confine null to the edges where it is unavoidable: input handling and database communication. Within business logic, represent absence explicitly, and treat an unexpected null as an exceptional condition to be raised rather than a value to be propagated.
- **Comprehensive error handling:** Managing unexpected conditions gracefully rather than allowing the application to crash or behave unpredictably.
- **Immutable data structures for concurrent programming:** Preventing insecure modification and ensuring thread safety.
- **Avoidance and isolation of risky operations:** Certain programming constructs introduce disproportionate risk and should be avoided where alternatives exist. String concatenation used to construct queries or commands, deserialization of untrusted data, and dynamic execution constructs such as `eval()` are common examples. Where such operations cannot be avoided, they must be encapsulated behind a well-defined, narrow interface and isolated from the rest of the application so that their risk surface is bounded and their behavior is auditable.
- **Safe memory and resource management:** Acquiring resources explicitly and releasing them reliably, regardless of execution path. This includes file handles, database connections, network sockets, and allocated memory. Failing to release resources introduces availability risk and, in some environments, exploitable memory conditions. Use language-provided constructs (such as `try-with-resources`, `using` blocks, or RAII patterns) to ensure deterministic cleanup. Avoid holding resources longer than necessary, and prefer scoped allocation where the language supports it.
- **Graceful and secure failure:** When a component encounters an error it cannot recover from, it must fail in a way that is safe, not just visible. Graceful failure means the application transitions to a known, controlled state rather than an undefined one. Secure failure means the error path does not leak internal state, stack traces, or implementation details to untrusted parties. Error messages presented externally should be generic; detailed diagnostic information should be captured in internal logs only. A failure that exposes system internals to an attacker is not graceful, regardless of how cleanly the exception is caught.
- **Least privilege operation at the code level:** Code should request and hold only the permissions it needs for the specific operation it is performing, and for no longer than that operation requires. This applies to database access (request read access when write is not needed), filesystem operations (scope access to the specific path required), API calls (request only the scopes the operation requires), and thread or process privileges (drop elevated permissions as soon as they are no longer needed). Least privilege at the code level limits the blast radius of a compromised component and reduces the set of actions an attacker can take if they gain control of execution within that component [Saltzer1975].

These are verifiable items that AppSec can assess during review.

#### 4.4.1. Canonical Input Handling

Input handling is a critical aspect of resilient coding. The most effective approach applies a minimal acceptable range for each parameter at the point of input through three practices:

- **Canonicalization/Normalization:** Ensures input data conforms to expected formats, types, lengths, and ranges before processing, preventing unexpected or malicious data from entering the system.
- **Validation:** Confirms input data meets specific criteria before processing. Prefer allowing only explicit, known-good values rather than attempting to reject unexpected values.
- **Sanitization:** Removes or neutralizes potentially harmful content, preventing malicious data from being executed or interpreted as code.

In some platforms, it may be beneficial to signal that an input value has been fully handled by passing it as a contextualized object rather than a scalar value after validation. If this pattern is used, document and communicate it to the team.

##### 4.4.1.1. The Canonical Parsing Principle

At trust boundaries, treat external input as untrusted data that must be parsed into a canonical internal type before business logic runs. This follows the "Parse, don't validate" approach [King2019]: instead of passing around loosely typed data and repeatedly checking it, perform one strict parse step at the boundary and fail closed if parsing does not succeed.

In this model, the resulting data structure is proof that required invariants hold ("Data Structure as Proof"). If code receives a parsed `CreateOrderRequest`, then required fields, type constraints, format rules, and boundary checks were already enforced by the parser. Core logic can then operate on trustworthy structures rather than reinterpreting raw request envelopes.

A practical boundary workflow is:

- Define an explicit input schema per operation, not a generic "accept anything" envelope.
- Parse only expected fields into a typed structure.
- Optionally reject the request when parsing fails or when forbidden/unknown fields are present, based on policy.
- Log parse failures and schema deviations with actionable context.

This approach reduces injection risk, prevents accidental propagation of malformed input, and improves analyzability because input handling behavior is centralized and deterministic.

Requests that deviate from expectation should be logged at minimum. The log entry should capture enough context to be useful in retrospect: the specific deviation observed, the request source, a timestamp, and any relevant session or user identity. A bare count or a generic "unexpected input" message does not support meaningful analysis.

In sensitive contexts, parse-fail-and-reject is the more defensible posture, and in some cases the correct one. The reasons to prefer rejection over silent discard are:

- **Reconnaissance detection.** Unexpected fields are frequently a sign that a client is probing the API surface: testing parameter names, injecting out-of-band values, or mapping the system's behavior. Rejecting the request raises the cost of this activity and makes the behavior more visible in logs.
- **Manipulation prevention.** In business-critical flows, an unexpected field may represent an attempt to supply a value the server should be deriving (see Section 4.4.1.2). Silently ignoring it allows the request to succeed, which confirms to the attacker that the attempt went unnoticed. Rejection removes that confirmation.
- **Defense against future code changes.** A value ignored today may be processed tomorrow if the codebase changes. Rejection is a documented, enforced boundary. Silent discard is a convention that can erode without notice.
- **Compliance and audit requirements.** In regulated environments, accepting and processing requests that contain anomalous input may create audit exposure even when no immediate harm results. Rejection produces a clear, defensible record of the boundary being enforced.

The choice between log-only and log-and-reject should be made deliberately, based on the sensitivity of the context and the risk profile of the deviation. It should not be left as an implicit default.

##### 4.4.1.2. The Isolated Integrity Principle

Isolation in this principle refers specifically to isolation of authority: integrity-critical facts must be controlled by server-side logic and data sources that clients cannot set, override, or indirectly bias.

> Ask: Could an untrusted caller directly set or indirectly bias this integrity-critical value?

Any value critical to the integrity of a system's state or business logic must be established in a trusted context that is safely isolated from client control, and derived from authoritative server-side sources. It must never be accepted directly from a client. This establishes a single source of truth for what is real and authoritative, rather than adopting the unknown integrity of client-supplied data.

Consider the analogy: a customer should not walk into a store, pick up an item, and tell the cashier how much it costs. The price is non-negotiable; it is derived from the store's own trusted system. The same logic applies to software. The client's role is to express intent (e.g., "I want to purchase item X"), not to dictate the facts of the transaction (e.g., "and it costs $0.01").

Applying this principle prevents entire classes of vulnerabilities related to business logic manipulation. Good candidates include:

- **Pricing and totals:** The final cost of items in a shopping cart must be calculated server-side from product IDs and quantities, referencing a secure price database.
- **User permissions:** A user's role or permission level must be loaded from a server-side session or database, not passed in a client request.
- **Object state:** The status of an order (e.g., "shipped," "paid") must be managed by an internal state machine, not accepted as a parameter from the client.

For example, when a user initiates checkout through a shopping API, the client might send:

```json
{
  "action": "checkout",
  "items": [
    {
      "itemId": "12345",
      "quantity": 2,
      "price": 5.97
    }
  ]
}
```

A server applying the Isolated Integrity Principle accepts only the client's intent, specifically to check out with the specified items at the specified quantities, and discards the client-supplied price entirely. It derives the actual price from its own inventory. It may log or reject the request outright for including a price field. The client expresses intent; the server enforces integrity.

A more advanced application of this principle involves JWTs (JSON Web Tokens). If a server accepts any algorithm specified in the JWT header for signature verification, it allows the client to dictate how the token's integrity is established, which is a direct violation of the principle.

The Isolated Integrity Principle is a direct application of the SSEM attribute of Integrity (Section 3.2.3.2): it ensures the system performs its intended function in an unimpaired manner, free from the manipulation that client-supplied data could otherwise introduce.

### 4.5. Dependency Stewardship

Dependency Stewardship involves applying SSEM attributes to select, integrate, monitor, and manage all dependencies, ensuring a securable system posture.

Dependency management sits at the core of Dependency Stewardship. Dependency management involves evaluating and updating third-party code. Stewardship carries the idea of maintaining an ongoing relationship with each dependency. Stewardship implies a long-term relationship with each dependency, with a focus on securability and its impact on first-party code. A dependency that passes initial evaluation can become a liability if functionality drifts, maintainers abandon it, codebases stagnate, and issues go unaddressed. The stewardship question is not only "Is this dependency acceptable today?" The stewardship question goes beyond "Is this dependency acceptable?" to "Will it remain reliable, maintainable, and trustworthy?"

Each candidate dependency should be evaluated for fit for the system. This reflects the FIASSE mindset: understanding the implications of dependencies on the securable posture of the system. To do this, assess SSEM principles against the dependency. Assess each SSEM principle:

- **Analyzability:** Understand each dependency's full scope, its purpose, and potential attack surface. Maintain a clear inventory and documented rationale.
- **Modifiability:** Design code with loosely coupled dependencies to facilitate updates or replacement.
- **Testability:** Ensure dependencies can be tested and have robust integration points.
- **Trustworthiness:** Prefer dependencies from authenticated, verifiable developers with a fully traceable delivery path, validated through trusted repository provenance.
- **Reliability:** Assess how a dependency's failure might affect system reliability and resilience, and develop mitigations.

In practice:
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies. - Avoid unnecessary dependencies, which introduce ongoing maintenance requirements.
- Regularly updating dependencies is a fundamental maintenance tactic that bolsters security. Updates often include fixes for known bugs, including security vulnerabilities, and should be integrated into sprints and performed regularly.
- Analyzing further when direct updates don't resolve known flaws. Decide whether to contribute a fix upstream, fork, or write your own.
- Maintaining a clear organizational policy for open-source dependencies, including remediating vulnerabilities through changes in first- or third-party code.
- Do not rely solely on CVE databases. A project's intent and health speak more to future securability than its advisory history. No advisory announces the silent drift of a service, or data source.

Not all shared resources are designed for systems requiring SSEM attributes. Adopting one creates a relationship with the code and its maintainers, or with a service and its operator, which the team owns for as long as the dependency remains.

Out-of-process dependencies introduce functional drift, threatening trustworthiness and reliability. Address this by taking architecture and abstraction steps. For further direction on out-of-process dependencies, such as external APIs, managed services, identity providers, and AI resources, refer to the related OWASP Security Verification Standard requirements catalog.

## 5. Integrating Security into Development Processes

### 5.1. Natively Extending Development Processes

A key principle for reducing friction and preparing development teams effectively is to integrate security into existing workflows rather than imposing separate, external security gates. This requires understanding current practices and extending them with purpose.

Security teams often occupy a reviewer position. While assurance activities matter, earlier engagement in requirements gathering, architecture, and design is more impactful and avoids positioning security as an adversary to the teams it needs to collaborate with. Security positioned as a partner is better informed and better placed to provide value.

Security teams carry responsibilities beyond assurance and development partnership, including maintaining defensive infrastructure, operating detection tooling, and coordinating incident response. These functions run continuously and independently of the development lifecycle. When software is built to the standard FIASSE describes, it reduces the burden on all three: fewer exploitable surfaces produce fewer incidents to detect and contain. These parallel responsibilities do not contradict FIASSE's integration model; they are the functions that benefit most directly when the software being defended is built to a securable standard.

Beyond the reviewer role, security can offer strategic extensions to development activities:

- **Architecture:** Incorporate security implications into architectural considerations. For example, throttling and DDoS protection help preserve business integrity.
- **Predefined checklists:** Develop flexible checklists that incorporate SSEM attributes and security considerations applicable across different contexts.
- **Usability:** Frame usability not just as aesthetics but as a foundation for trust. Clear error messages, intuitive permissions management, and predictable interface behavior all contribute to a more secure user experience.

### 5.2. The Role of Merge Reviews

While software engineering lacks the formal mentorship structures of some other engineering disciplines, the merge review (or pull request review) serves as a critical point for guidance, validation, and knowledge transfer. For security, this is where securable code review can scale effectively. It functions as an agile training ground where developers learn from peers in a constructive environment. SSEM attributes provide a concrete and shared basis for these reviews.

Teams should treat merge reviews as guardrails, not gates. The goal is to grow the FIASSE mindset within the team and to make the review process a positive experience for developers, without introducing unnecessary friction or delay.

Merge reviews are also an appropriate venue for practicing threat awareness at the code level: asking "What can go wrong?" within the bounded scope of a changeset makes it easier to identify risks and vulnerabilities that might be harder to isolate in a larger system review. Findings that reveal design-level concerns should be escalated into the formal threat model rather than addressed solely as code-level fixes. Sections 5.2.1 through 5.2.5 define the mechanism that makes the guardrail concrete.

#### 5.2.1. The Securability Report

Every merge produces an informational report. Code review through merge requests is an effective technique for identifying security vulnerabilities early in the development process [OWASP-CRG]; the report is that review's instrument. Automated analysis supplies its base: scanning results and securability signals scoped to the changeset. Automation can surface known or common issues, but it cannot interpret the context of a change or understand the architecture of the system. Review brings that context to bear, adding an assessment expressed in SSEM vocabulary where the change warrants it. The report is generated unconditionally and blocks nothing by default. This is what allows securable review to scale where whole-application security review could not: automation runs on every change, while reviewer attention goes where the report and the change's risk profile direct it.

#### 5.2.2. The Advisory Default

The report's first job is to make the securability consequences of a change visible at the moment the change is cheapest to discuss. Read this way, it is a teaching instrument: the place where developing engineers see SSEM reasoning applied to their own code, and where review comments become transferable patterns rather than one-off corrections. The collaborative nature of the review carries the rest. It allows the sharing of insight and expertise, and provides a fresh perspective that individual developers may lose through familiarity with their own code. When FIASSE-trained security professionals participate, they contribute insights that over time elevate the broader team's understanding of SSEM attributes and their implications.

#### 5.2.3. Gating as a Policy Decision

A team, with its product owner and security partnership, may elevate designated finding classes, components, or risk thresholds to blocking status. Wherever gating is enabled, an override path must exist. Exercising the override is not a failure of the mechanism; it is the mechanism completing: the business retains the authority to accept vulnerable code, and the override records who accepted what, and why (Accountability, Section 3.2.2.2).

#### 5.2.4. The Audit Trail

Performed at the merge, the mechanism produces a structured audit trail as a by-product of ordinary work. Findings are logged with each report. Each gating decision point is logged, and where an override is exercised, the approval or denial is captured. Every entry is timestamped, attributable, and reviewable. This trail is what proof-based compliance consumes: placed in SBOM attestations, it demonstrates that security expectations were evaluated on every change and that acceptance decisions were made by a named authority. The evidence maps directly onto obligations under the EU Cyber Resilience Act and the practices of NIST SP 800-218 (SSDF), and it arrives without a separate evidence-gathering exercise because the mechanism generated it while the work was being done. This is Section 6.1's principle extended from tests to process: attestation assembled from living records rather than reconstructed after the fact.

#### 5.2.5. Posture over Pass Rates

What the organization manages is the resulting security posture over time, not the pass rate of individual merges. A recurring override on the same finding class is not a compliance failure to be enforced harder at the merge; it is a signal pointing upstream: a requirements gap or a securability gap to be addressed where it originates (Section 4.1.2).

### 5.3. Early Integration: Planning and Requirements

FIASSE advocates for integrating security at the earliest stages of development, particularly during planning and requirements definition. This ensures security is a foundational design element rather than a retrofit. Security expectations set at design time never enter the remediation queue at all; once a flaw ships, industry data puts the average time from finding to fix at 252 days [Veracode-SoSS-2025].

The primary mechanism for early integration is active security team participation in requirements gathering, as described in Section 4.1.2. By contributing Security Features, Threat Scenarios, and Security Acceptance Criteria to the requirements process, the security team ensures that security expectations are explicit, testable, and integrated into the development workflow from the start.

## 6. Common AppSec Anti-Patterns

### 6.1. Security Controls in the Code Creation Process

Four artifacts collapse into the single word "control." A **catalog control** is an assurance artifact that declares a protection must exist within a system, giving risk management and external evaluation something to select and assess. A **security requirement** specifies what the code must observably do to produce that protection. It is scoped by product, funded by the business, carrying acceptance criteria. A **security feature** is the resulting implementation. **Verification evidence** proves the feature meets its criteria and that the control is genuinely met. The activities between them (allocation, specification, implementation, verification) are where security is engineered into software. Skipping these steps produces two predictable failures.

The catalogs themselves (NIST SP 800-53, ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A, PCI DSS, and their equivalents) are legitimate, valuable, and a rich input to requirements gathering: security brings a relevant control forward as context, and product and development shape a concrete requirement with explicit buy-in. Every failure below occurs in their application, where the catalogs were always designed to require translation.

#### 6.1.1. The Control-as-Requirement Fallacy

The control-as-requirement fallacy treats a catalog item as a specification the programmer should already know to build. The ecosystem invites the conflation: PCI DSS names its controls "requirements," and 800-53's "controls" span policy to mechanism. Hence the weight of the terminology note in Section 2. When translation is skipped, development receives items that look like requirements but were never gathered as requirements: never scoped, never funded, never given acceptance criteria. The programmer is expected to infer an implementation, but a catalog control cannot support the inference; it is deliberately implementation-agnostic and system-scoped. "Enforce approved authorizations" (AC-3) is not verifiable against a codebase as written; the auditor reads it one way, the programmer inferred another, and the friction lands on development instead of on the missing process. Translated, the same control becomes a requirement: *every request to a document endpoint verifies the authenticated caller's permission on that document server-side; unauthorized requests return 403 and are logged with the caller's identity*. Development implements that as an authorization check in the document service, and a passing test against those criteria is the audit evidence. The control told no one what to build; the requirement did.

#### 6.1.2. The Control-as-Protection Fallacy

The control-as-protection fallacy reads the documented existence of a control as a property of the software. Many controls are properly satisfied outside the application: platform, network, process, or inheritance. That is sound assurance practice and corrosive engineering shorthand: a protection provided by the environment defends the code only in that environment, and even correctly-external controls leave residual obligations inside the code. For example the fact that the code should accept identity only from the trusted boundary and fail closed when the upstream protection is absent may go unspecified because "the control is handled." Unallocated security controls fail in another way: each team assumes the other owns them. Software is defensible only when the code's share of every relevant control is specified, implemented, and verifiable.

#### 6.1.3. The Requirements Process as the Corrective

The requirements process supplies what the catalog deliberately omits. *Allocation*: decide and record which layer satisfies each control, including the code's residual share. *Specification*: express that share as observable behavior with acceptance criteria. ASVS is a ready-made requirements library at this altitude, so much translation is selection rather than authorship. *Adequacy*: assessment verifies that a control exists and operates, not that it suffices against this product's threat model; the catalog is a floor, never a ceiling. The expectations follow. Security brings controls forward, participates in requirements (correcting at its source the friction Sections 2.5 and 5.1 describe), and owns the control-to-requirement mapping. Product weighs; the business funds. Development implements to specification, keeps the verifying tests green, and answers a control-shaped demand that arrives without criteria by requesting the requirement, not inferring one. The payoff is symmetric: development receives specifications instead of insinuations, and security receives audit evidence assembled from living tests. This point-in-time attestation is a state; a requirement under test is a property.

The corrective discipline is the first FIASSE value (Section 2). A control describes a protection. A requirement specifies behavior. A feature delivers it. Evidence proves it. Mistaking a control for a requirement burdens developers with inference; mistaking it for a feature dresses software in paper. Catalogs make software defensible in exactly one way: as input to the code creation process, translated on the way in.

### 6.2. The "Shoveling Left" Phenomenon

"Shoveling Left" is the practice of supplying impractical information to developers and leaving the responsibility on them to make sense of it. This anti-pattern manifests in how vulnerabilities are reported, how training is conducted, and how testing results are delivered. It undermines AppSec's credibility and leads to developer disengagement.

The corrective discipline is the **Actionable Security Intelligence Principle**: security teams collaborate with development teams on systemic flaw reductions by producing findings, guidance, and training in a form developers can act on within their normal engineering workflow. Raw tool output, exploit-centric narratives, and unfiltered vulnerability lists are information, not yet intelligence. The principle holds that security output becomes valuable only once it has been translated into prioritized, engineering-grounded direction calibrated to the developer's context. Shoveling Left is the direct inversion of this principle, and the sub-sections that follow examine two of its most common forms.

#### 6.2.1. Ineffective Vulnerability Reporting

A prime example of "Shoveling Left" is routing raw output from security scanning tools directly into the development team's backlog without context, prioritization, or actionable guidance. While initial progress may follow, momentum typically dissipates and issues tend to recur in a "whack-a-mole" pattern. Raw tool output alone is rarely sufficient to drive sustained improvement.

To avoid this pattern, AppSec should:

1. **Focus on true positives:** Validate findings to confirm accuracy before routing them to development.
2. **Analyze trends and pooling patterns:** Look across multiple findings and tools to identify systemic issues rather than isolated incidents.
3. **Identify root causes:** Address underlying structural problems rather than symptoms.
4. **Prioritize by impact:** Focus on issues that are widespread or affect sensitive resources.
5. **Collaborate on solutions:** Work with development to identify wide-impact engineering solutions rather than line-level mitigations.
6. **Verify fixes:** Confirm that remediation is effective, and consider automated regression tests to prevent recurrence.

#### 6.2.2. Pitfalls of Exploit-First Training

Security training for developers that primarily emphasizes exploitation techniques, often framed as "learn the hack to stop the attack," is another form of "Shoveling Left." As Section 2.5 establishes, understanding how to compromise a system is not the same as knowing how to engineer a robust one. The hacker mindset and the engineer mindset are complementary disciplines, not interchangeable ones.

This type of training is ineffective because it does not equip developers with the engineering principles needed for daily work. It also fails to provide the knowledge needed to identify or build code with inherently securable qualities as defined by SSEM. At best, developers gain a superficial understanding of risks without the practical knowledge to implement systemic preventative measures. This can produce a false sense of security and does little to foster the proactive, engineering-focused examination of "What can go wrong?" The goal is better design and implementation, not line-level mitigations applied after the fact.

### 6.3. Strategic Use of Security Output

Scanning and testing tools are valuable for understanding current security posture, but their output must be used strategically. It should not be assumed that security requirements are implicit, or that developers can be held responsible for missing controls if clear expectations were never set. Productive software engineers operate within a structured workflow designed to deliver value. Disrupting that workflow degrades software quality and produces the conditions that application security seeks to prevent.

Fix requests must not circumvent the processes software engineers rely on. Bypassing established workflows leads to misunderstandings and mistakes. AppSec should not expect developers to act on security findings without clear, actionable information and the opportunity to work through their standard processes.

This section is the **Actionable Security Intelligence Principle** (Section 6.2) applied to tool output. Scanner results, penetration test findings, and monitoring signals are raw material, and the principle holds that they become useful only when converted into specific, engineering-grounded direction tied to requirements, acceptance criteria, and the team's existing workflow. Treating security output as finished intelligence rather than input to it produces the same breakdown the Shoveling Left discussion describes, just arriving through a different channel.

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities

### 7.1. The Role of the Security Team

The security team ensures timely delivery of securable outcomes by setting expectations early and letting engineering's own processes carry them: early engagement in requirements gathering, design, and architecture review sets the guardrails for development.

The security team is not responsible for adherence to architecture or feature requirements. That accountability belongs to the development team, enforced through standard Quality Assurance and User Acceptance processes. Security metrics from application security testing tools and penetration tests therefore measure partnership effectiveness, not development compliance. This distinction lets the security team invest in requirements, design, and assurance rather than policing developers for line-level fixes.

When requirements are complete and acceptance criteria are explicit, those metrics measure implementation completeness against a defined baseline. When requirements are absent or vague, the same metrics measure noise.

A stagnant security posture signals the need for adjustments to development culture or leadership. The security team can influence this by promoting FIASSE and sponsoring education, and by investing in design activities that put ownership of the code's security posture where it belongs: with the engineers who build it. Accepting the limits of its authority is part of the role; the development team balances business value creation with security needs.

The security team's effectiveness is limited by software quality. SSEM makes this relationship explicit: a securable system's attributes (Analyzability, Modifiability, Testability, and others) define well-engineered software. A development team that pursues quality builds software more amenable to security analysis, faster to remediate, and more resilient over time. Application security cannot outperform the engineering practices beneath it.

#### 7.1.1. The Strategic Case for the Shift

The role described above, security engaging upstream in requirements and design rather than downstream in review and testing, is not the norm in most organizations today. The shift toward it will meet resistance. The resistance is predictable: security careers are often built on finding-bugs work, security team charters are often written around gate-keeping activities, and business leadership has been trained to measure security through vulnerability counts and audit outcomes only, rather than through partnership indicators. Recognizing this is a precondition to changing it.

The shift is strategically necessary regardless. Security expertise applied at the requirements and design stages produces more leverage per hour than the same expertise applied to post-implementation review; the framework's premise is that this leverage is where security's remaining capacity should be invested. In an environment where AI-assisted development multiplies the volume of code produced, the option of scaling gate-keeping to keep up with generation does not exist. The security function either moves upstream or falls further behind.

#### 7.1.2. Capacity Relief Through Agentic AppSec

The transition is made feasible by agentic AppSec tooling: AI-assisted security analysis, triage, and pattern detection operating on the code and its changes. These capabilities take on the mechanical portion of the reviewer role, allowing security expertise to be redirected upstream without leaving the downstream unattended. Adopting agentic tooling deliberately, as a capacity-relief mechanism tied to a role shift, is different from adopting it as another scanner producing findings to route into backlogs. The former enables the strategic move this section describes; the latter reproduces the Shoveling Left pattern (Section 6.2) at higher volume.

#### 7.1.3. Transition, Not Switchover

Security teams making this shift operate in dual mode during the transition. They continue to perform assurance activities the business depends on while progressively taking on requirements and design participation. The gate-keeping role is not abandoned before the participation role is established; the participation role is grown into as capacity is freed by agentic tooling and by the maturation of upstream practices. Attempting to switch cold produces a gap that erodes the security team's standing before the new role has a chance to demonstrate value.

#### 7.1.4. Business-Leadership Alignment Is a Precondition

The security team cannot make this shift alone. Business leadership must fund it, explicitly accept that assurance metrics will improve as a downstream indicator rather than a direct target, and back the security team's presence in requirements and design activities. Without that backing, security's attempt to engage upstream will be treated by engineering leadership as an intrusion rather than a partnership, and the shift will fail. The security leader's first responsibility in adopting FIASSE is to secure this alignment; the second is to plan the transition against it.

#### 7.1.5. Staffing Implications

Some security staff will make the transition and some will not. The skills required for effective participation in requirements and design work, engineering literacy, product-domain fluency, comfort with ambiguity, and willingness to influence rather than gate are not the same as the skills that made a strong reviewer or tester (which are still needed). This is a hiring, development, and retention question that leadership must plan for openly rather than discover as attrition. Staff who prefer the reviewer role are not failing; the role they were hired into is changing, and the organization must handle that change with the same care it would apply to any other significant restructure.

### 7.2. Senior Software Engineers

Senior software engineers are crucial to any Application Security program's success, and their value increases as AI-assisted development becomes standard. AI tools generate code at scale, and agentic tooling can analyze it at matching scale, but neither owns an outcome: their output is input to engineering judgment, not a substitute for it. Evaluating design decisions, setting trust boundaries, and deciding whether an implementation meets security intent remain software engineering responsibilities, grounded in SSEM attributes and established engineering principles. Exercising those responsibilities is the senior engineer's key differentiator.

Security professionals should collaborate closely with senior engineers in design activities, treating them as primary technical partners for FIASSE adoption.

Senior engineers apply the question "What can go wrong?" at every stage of development, from initial design through merge review, including AI-generated code. They drive the creation of Security Requirements, Acceptance Criteria, and Threat Scenarios that inform both manual implementation and AI-assisted generation.

As AI-assisted development becomes routine, senior engineers craft and maintain prompt engineering standards that embed SSEM attributes and securable coding expectations into generation workflows.

They champion and schedule regular dependency maintenance, mentor less experienced developers, and liaise with security teams to keep security alignment anchored in engineering practice.

### 7.3. Developing Software Engineers

Developing engineers benefit from mental models like SSEM and the practices FIASSE describes. They may not yet have an intuitive sense for "What can go wrong?" but can develop it through structured guidance, merge reviews, and pair programming. FIASSE provides context for why certain practices matter, helping engineers build judgment in good and bad code. This judgment is crucial in a landscape where AI coding assistants generate large volumes of plausible code quickly.

The primary objective for developing engineers is to become strong software engineers. Security outcomes follow from sound engineering practice, and the two are not separable. Working from clear Requirements and Acceptance Criteria before beginning a change gives developing engineers a visible target.

Foundational securable practices reinforce this development. Writing unit tests that cover exceptional conditions and out-of-bounds values strengthens Testability. Applying defensive coding techniques, particularly input validation and output encoding at trust boundaries, produces code that is resilient by default. Exercising due diligence before introducing new external dependencies keeps the trust surface and ongoing maintenance burden under control. Understanding trust boundaries in the code they write and seeking to understand the broader architecture grounds day-to-day decisions in the system's security model.

Engineers scrutinize AI-generated code with the same critical eye as any other source. They review output against SSEM attributes, check trust boundaries, and verify it meets defined acceptance criteria before accepting it. They also learn to incorporate FIASSE concepts into prompts, specifying securable qualities like input validation, error handling, and least privilege.

Studying FIASSE and SSEM directly builds a mental model that turns engineering fundamentals into securable outcomes.

### 7.4. Product Owners and Managers

A FIASSE-literate Product Owner is a more effective decision-maker, communicator, and team leader. Understanding SSEM attributes and FIASSE principles changes the quality of decisions and conversations they lead.

At the specification level, a FIASSE-literate Product Owner assesses backlog items for securability implications, not just feature value. Maintainability work, dependency updates, and architectural improvements become investments in the product's long-term defensibility, not technical overhead.

A Product Owner who understands SSEM can author or validate criteria that reflect genuine security intent. This reduces the gap between what was specified and what was built, directly supporting the principle that implementation completeness against defined criteria is a measurable security outcome.

As the translator of technical decisions into business terms, a FIASSE-literate Product Owner communicates risk more accurately and credibly with leadership, customers, and auditors. They interpret threat findings in business terms to make informed decisions about risk acceptance, mitigation priority, and requirement changes.

Product leadership shapes securability through scope decisions and culture. Scope cuts and deadline pressures frequently target work that appears non-functional, including input validation, error handling, logging, and dependency updates. A Product Owner familiar with SSEM recognizes when a proposed cut degrades a securable attribute. The security posture that results is a product outcome the Product Owner is accountable for. Culture follows what leadership visibly values: a Product Owner who asks about threat scenarios, requires security acceptance criteria, and treats dependency maintenance as a scheduled commitment signals that securability is a first-class product quality.

FIASSE literacy supports the external and exceptional moments of the product role. In vendor selection and third-party integration decisions, it enables substantive evaluation of whether a proposed integration introduces dependency risks, whether the vendor's practices align with the team's stewardship standards, and whether the integration design respects the system's trust boundaries. A FIASSE-literate Product Owner can engage meaningfully in incident response, understanding what was affected and what systemic changes are needed. Post-incident, they are better positioned to drive backlog changes that address root causes rather than symptoms.

## 8. Organizational Adoption of FIASSE

FIASSE does not require a rigid adoption sequence, but organizations benefit from a deliberate implementation plan. The following steps represent a practical path toward successful integration:

1. **Assess current practices.** Evaluate organizational readiness for FIASSE through discussions with key stakeholders and a review of existing workflows.
   - Identify existing security practices and how they align with SSEM attributes.
   - Determine the current level of familiarity with software engineering principles among development teams.
   - Identify the misalignments that FIASSE can address.
   - Determine if the organization has a functioning requirements or planning practice that security can insert into, or whether work moves from idea to code through informal channels. The method of integrating FIASSE upstream varies depending on how this is done.
   - Determine whether senior engineers with both design maturity and calendar capacity exist in sufficient numbers to participate and champion FIASSE within their teams. The framework's practices (Sections 5.2 and 7.2) depend on this bench. Agentic tooling may be required to reduce this pressure (Section 8.1.1).
   - Determine whether merge reviews are substantive rather than rubber-stamp, whether mentorship happens in practice rather than in principle, and whether quality is treated as a first-class engineering concern. FIASSE extends healthy engineering culture; it does not create it.
   - Where a prerequisite is thin or absent, name it in the assessment output. Section 8.1 (Degraded-Mode Adoption) describes how to proceed when prerequisites are not fully met; the honest naming is what makes that path usable.

2. **Integrate SSEM terminology.** Deliberately incorporate SSEM attributes, including Maintainability, Trustworthiness, and Reliability, and their sub-attributes into developer documentation, coding standards, style guides, and training materials. This builds a common language for discussing and evaluating securability. Favor securable-property language over static-state language in these materials: "built so security can be maintained" rather than "secure."

3. **Identify key influencers.** Find senior engineers and stakeholders who can internalize the framework and champion FIASSE adoption. These individuals should have a strong grounding in software engineering.

4. **Educate and train teams.** Provide role-specific training on FIASSE and SSEM to key influencers and integrate it into onboarding and continuous learning programs.
   - Both Development and AppSec should understand that FIASSE is to be discussed in the context of software engineering, not as a separate security initiative.
   - After initial training, ongoing delivery should occur within merge reviews, architecture discussions, and requirements sessions. Leaders should bring FIASSE into these activities directly.

5. **Adopt agentic AppSec tooling as capacity relief.** The AppSec role shift FIASSE describes (Section 7.1) depends on security expertise being available for requirements and design work. In most organizations, that capacity does not exist without deliberate relief from the mechanical portion of the reviewer role. Agentic AppSec tooling such as AI-assisted analysis, triage, and pattern detection operating on the code and its changes is the mechanism for that relief. Adopt it with a clear intent: the security capacity it frees is reinvested upstream, not consumed processing more findings. Tie tooling adoption to specific upstream engagements the security team will now be able to take on. Without that tie, agentic tooling produces higher-volume Shoveling Left (Section 6.2) rather than the strategic shift the framework aims for.

6. **Foster collaboration.** Promote regular engagement between AppSec and Development. Discourage isolated reviews; encourage AppSec to participate in development activities such as requirements gathering.

7. **Monitor and improve continuously.** FIASSE is an ongoing process. Use real-time security observability to gather insights that refine security strategies and FIASSE implementation over time.

### 8.1. Degraded-Mode Adoption

The readiness assessment (Step 1) may identify a prerequisite gap: a sparse requirements process, a thin senior engineer bench, or an engineering culture that does not yet support substantive merge reviews and mentorship. FIASSE is still adoptable in that situation, but the adoption must be shaped around the gap rather than proceeding as if the prerequisite were present.

Three degraded-mode options are supplied here, and they are not mutually exclusive:

#### 8.1.1. Compensate with Agentic Assistance

Agentic AppSec tooling (Step 5) and AI-assisted development can compensate for a thin senior bench by expanding the throughput that would otherwise consume senior engineers' scarce hours: information sharing across teams, summary code analysis at merge time, and automated security testing on every change. What agentic assistance does not replace is the judgment the bench exists to provide. Design evaluation, trust-boundary decisions, and mentorship remain software engineering work (Section 7.2). This is a live strategic option, not a future consideration. It does not eliminate the need for the senior bench, but it reduces the depth required for FIASSE to begin producing value. The organization still owes itself an investment plan for growing the bench over time.

#### 8.1.2. Invest in the Prerequisite First

Where the prerequisite gap is large and the organization has appetite for it, the honest path is to invest in the prerequisite before or alongside FIASSE adoption. Requirements-process work, engineering culture work, and senior hiring are legitimate FIASSE-adjacent investments, and framing them as such makes them fundable. Section 2.4's claim that quality is the limiting factor for security applies here: FIASSE cannot compensate for a floor of engineering practice that is too low to build on.

#### 8.1.3. Adopt Partially with Named Gaps

Where full adoption is out of reach, adopt the parts of FIASSE that the prerequisites do support and name the parts that are on hold. A team with a strong senior bench but no requirements process can start with merge-review threat awareness and SSEM vocabulary in code review, and defer requirements integration until the process exists. A team with a functioning requirements process but a thin bench can start with requirements integration and defer the mentorship-heavy practices. Naming the gaps prevents the partial adoption from being mistaken for full adoption, which is what protects the framework's indicators (Section 8.2) from being read against the wrong baseline.

Degraded-mode adoption is a legitimate posture, not a failure to adopt. What is not legitimate is claiming full adoption while operating without the prerequisites; that produces the pattern where FIASSE gets blamed for outcomes that were structurally out of its reach.

### 8.2. Indicators of Adoption Effectiveness

FIASSE does not replace the assurance metrics organizations already track. It expects those metrics to move as a downstream effect of upstream engagement (Section 2.5). The indicators below let a team distinguish "the framework is producing the effect it claims" from "adoption is not producing the effect and something needs to change."

#### 8.2.1. Leading Indicators

Should be visible within one to two quarters of good-faith adoption.

- Security acceptance criteria appear on user stories and feature specifications as a matter of course, not by exception.
- Threat scenarios and security features are recorded during requirements gathering rather than surfaced during review.
- Security team members participate in requirements refinement, architecture reviews, and design discussions on a standing basis, not ad hoc.
- Merge review conversations reference SSEM attributes as design language rather than security jargon.
- The volume of security escalations arising from merge reviews declines as expectations shift upstream.

#### 8.2.2. Lagging Indicators

Should be visible within one to two years of good-faith adoption.

- Findings churn (the rate at which the same class of finding recurs across releases) declines.
- Fix durability improves: fixes stay fixed rather than regressing under subsequent changes.
- Turnaround from finding to durable remediation shortens.
- Vulnerability class distribution shifts away from missing-or-inconsistent-requirement causes toward classes that lie outside what upstream requirements can reach (Section 4.1.2's residual: novel classes, supply-chain compromises, cryptographic weaknesses).
- The proportion of security findings that map to a specified requirement grows, and the proportion that map to unspecified expectations shrinks.

#### 8.2.3. Distinguishing Framework Failure from Adoption Failure

Where leading indicators are not moving after two quarters of good-faith adoption effort, the failure is in adoption: the readiness assessment (Step 1) likely missed a prerequisite gap, or the AppSec role shift (Section 7.1) has not received the business-leadership backing it requires. Where leading indicators have moved but lagging indicators do not follow within the stated windows, the failure is in the framework's causal claim for that team, and the team is owed an honest reassessment rather than a longer runway. FIASSE is not exempt from the burden of showing it produces the effect it claims; naming the criteria for that showing is part of what makes it a framework rather than a manifesto.

## 9. Conclusion

Organizations invest in secure coding initiatives and security testing, yet application security outcomes remain difficult to improve at scale. The root cause is structural. Security expertise has not been applied where it produces the most value, and developers have not been given explicit, engineering-grounded expectations for what securable software looks like. FIASSE exists to change that.

The central shift FIASSE asks for is a change in how security is applied. Securable software is software whose engineering qualities allow it to remain defensible as the system evolves and the threat landscape changes. That shift changes how engineers build, how security teams engage with development, and gives leaders the grounding to make more informed decisions about risk and investment. Securability is the engineering discipline that makes building software in an ever-shifting threat landscape reasonable.

For Software Engineers: the practices in this document are extensions of what good engineering already looks like. Apply SSEM attributes to the code you write and the code you review. Principles including defensive coding, clear trust boundaries, transparent instrumentation, complete requirements, and dependency stewardship will guide you in building securable software without weighing you down.

For security professionals: the leverage point is earlier and further upstream than testing. Requirements, design, and architecture are where security expectations become structural. Set them there. Use SSEM as the shared vocabulary that lets you engage with development teams on engineering terms rather than security mandates. Measure the partnership through implementation completeness against defined criteria, not through vulnerability counts alone.

For Product Owners: the security posture of your product is a product decision. Every scope cut that removes input validation, every sprint that defers dependency maintenance, and every story accepted without security acceptance criteria is a decision with a security consequence. FIASSE literacy makes those consequences visible before they become incidents. The adoption steps in Section 8 provide a concrete starting point.

Regardless of organizational size, domain, or technology stack, the path to better security outcomes runs through the same place: engineers who understand what securable software looks like, teams that have the vocabulary to reason about it, and leaders who create the conditions for it to be built. The investment is in engineering culture, and the return compounds over time.

There is no static state of secure. Securability is a discipline that begins with the next line of code written or generated, the next requirement authored, the next merge reviewed. Start there.

## Appendix A: Measuring SSEM Attributes

Measuring the attributes defined by SSEM quantifies and evaluates the securable qualities of software. The following approaches cover each core attribute and provide actionable indicators to guide improvement.

### A.1. Measuring Maintainability

The quantitative metrics in this section draw on the SIG maintainability model [Heitlager2007].

#### A.1.1. Analyzability

**Quantitative:**

- **Volume (Lines of Code):** Tracked per module/system. Lower LoC for a given functionality can indicate better analyzability.
- **Duplication percentage:** Measured by static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, PMD). Lower is better.
- **Unit size (e.g., mLoC/cLoC):** Average lines of code per method or class. Excessively large units are harder to analyze.
- **Unit complexity (e.g., Cyclomatic Complexity):** Measured by static analysis tools. Lower complexity per unit is generally better.
- **Comment density/quality:** Ratio of comment lines to code lines, or qualitative review of comment usefulness.

**Qualitative/process-based:**

- **Time to Understand (TTU):** Average time for a developer unfamiliar with a section of code to understand its purpose and flow for a specific task.
- **Developer surveys:** Periodic developer ratings of the analyzability of modules they work with.

#### A.1.2. Modifiability

**Quantitative:**

- **Module coupling (afferent/efferent):** Number of incoming and outgoing dependencies for modules. Lower afferent coupling typically indicates a module is easier to change without broad impact.
- **Change impact size:** Number of files/modules typically affected by a common type of change. Smaller is better.
- **Regression rate:** Percentage of changes that introduce new defects. Lower is better.

**Qualitative/process-based:**

- **Ease of change assessment:** During code reviews, assess how difficult a hypothetical related change would be.
- **Time to implement change:** Average time to complete standard types of modifications or feature enhancements.

#### A.1.3. Testability

**Quantitative:**

- **Code coverage:** Percentage of code covered by automated tests (unit, integration). Higher is generally better.
- **Unit test density:** Number of unit tests per KLoC or per class/module.
- **Mocking/stubbing complexity:** Difficulty or setup required to isolate units for testing.

**Qualitative/process-based:**

- **Ease of writing tests:** Developer feedback on how straightforward it is to write meaningful tests for new or existing code.
- **Test execution time:** Excessively long test suite runs can reduce testing frequency, indirectly affecting testability in practice.

#### A.1.4. Observability

**Quantitative:**

- **Log coverage:** Percentage of trust boundaries and security-sensitive operations emitting structured log events with sufficient context (identity, action, outcome, timestamp).
- **Instrumentation coverage:** Fraction of critical execution paths exposing health and performance metrics through a standardized API (e.g., authentication failure counts, input validation error rates, resource utilization).
- **Alert signal-to-noise ratio:** Ratio of actionable alerts to total alerts fired over a reporting period. A low ratio indicates instrumentation that generates noise rather than insight.
- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD):** Average elapsed time between an anomalous event occurring and its appearance in monitoring output. Lower values indicate more effective instrumentation.

**Qualitative/process-based:**

- **Structured logging review:** Assessment of whether log entries include sufficient context to support incident analysis. Specifically whether the who, what, where, when, and outcome of security-relevant events are captured, not just that an event occurred.
- **Code-level instrumentation audit:** Review of whether observability is built into the code itself at key points, or whether it depends entirely on external tooling. A system that is not instrumented at the code level is opaque by construction; this audit identifies those blind spots.
- **Failure-path observability:** Assessment of whether error and recovery paths produce observable output. Silent failures and exception swallowing are common gaps; code paths that produce no signal under failure conditions should be identified and instrumented.
- **UI and operator feedback review:** Assessment of whether the system surfaces meaningful state to operators and end users at decision points (including error messages, permission feedback, and session state) without leaking internal implementation details.

### A.2. Measuring Trustworthiness

#### A.2.1. Confidentiality

**Quantitative:**

- **Number of identified data leaks:** From penetration tests, code reviews, or incidents.
- **Access control violations:** Number of logged unauthorized access attempts, whether prevented or successful.

**Qualitative/process-based:**

- **Data classification adherence:** Review of how well data is classified and whether protections align with that classification.
- **Principle of least privilege review:** Assessment of whether components and users have only the necessary permissions.
- **Effectiveness of encryption:** Review of encryption algorithms used and key management practices.

#### A.2.2. Accountability

**Quantitative:**

- **Audit log coverage:** Percentage of critical system actions logged with sufficient detail.
- **Traceability success rate:** Percentage of audited actions that can be uniquely attributed to an entity.

**Qualitative/process-based:**

- **Audit log review findings:** Results from periodic reviews of audit logs for completeness and usefulness.
- **Non-repudiation strength:** Assessment of the evidence quality linking actions to entities (e.g., use of digital signatures).

#### A.2.3. Authenticity

**Quantitative:**

- **Authentication failures:** Number of failed login attempts (can indicate brute-forcing or misconfiguration).
- **Authentication mechanism coverage:** Percentage of authentication points implementing factors appropriate to the context, with a documented rationale for each configuration choice.

**Qualitative/process-based:**

- **Verification of identities:** Review of processes for verifying user and system identities.
- **Adaptability of authentication mechanisms:** Assessment of whether the authentication system's design supports ongoing analysis, modification, and verification, testability of authentication flows, auditability of authentication events, and the ability to adapt controls as threats evolve.

### A.3. Measuring Reliability

#### A.3.1. Availability

**Quantitative:**

- Uptime percentage (e.g., 99.99%).
- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF).
- Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR).

**Qualitative/process-based:**

- **Redundancy review:** Assessment of system redundancy for critical components.
- **Disaster recovery test results.**

#### A.3.2. Integrity

**Quantitative:**

- Number of data corruption incidents.
- Checksum/hash validation success rate for data at rest and in transit.

**Qualitative/process-based:**

- **Input validation effectiveness:** Review of input validation mechanisms at trust boundaries.
- **System file integrity monitoring alerts.**

#### A.3.3. Resilience

**Quantitative:**

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO) adherence:** Frequency with which RTOs are met following an incident.
- **Performance under stress:** System performance metrics during load testing or simulated attacks (e.g., DDoS simulation).

**Qualitative/process-based:**

- **Defensive coding practices review:** Assessment of code for input validation, output encoding, and robust error handling.
- **Incident response plan effectiveness:** Review of how well the system and team recover from security incidents or operational failures.

### A.4. Scoring and Enhancement Suggestions

Where teams choose to combine SSEM indicators into a composite score, the score should be treated as a directional management aid, not as a statement of assurance, compliance, or absolute security. A score can help compare a system against itself over time and can help surface the weakest attributes first, but it should not be used to imply that the codebase is "secure" or that a single number captures the system's securable posture.

Scoring works best when it is paired with concrete enhancement suggestions that are specific to the attribute being measured. Those suggestions should be:

- **Attribute-specific:** Tie each recommendation to a named SSEM attribute or sub-attribute so the team knows what quality is being improved.
- **Actionable:** State the next engineering step, not just the deficiency. For example, "add boundary validation for external input" is more useful than "improve input handling."
- **Evidence-based:** Explain which metric, review finding, or observed behavior triggered the suggestion.
- **Comparable over time:** Report deltas against prior scans so teams can see whether a change improved or degraded the relevant attribute.
- **Context-aware:** Distinguish between a systemic weakness and a local exception so teams do not optimize for the score at the expense of the architecture.
- **Reviewed when material:** For high-impact systems or significant drops in score, require a reviewer to confirm that the suggested change is appropriate before it becomes a development commitment.

The most useful scoring outputs therefore include three parts: the score itself, the rationale for the score, and a short list of prioritized changes that would improve the underlying attribute. This preserves the educational value of the framework while avoiding the false precision that can occur when a composite score is mistaken for a complete security judgment.
