-------------------------------------------

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:** Make a copy of this template to draft your charter in collaboration with others or privately. The OASIS Project Administrator [project-admin@oasis-open.org](mailto:project-admin@oasis-open.org) is available to answer questions and offer suggestions.

If you’d like to participate in this Open Project (OP), please contact [join@oasis-open.org](mailto:join@oasis-open.org). Details on Open Project sponsorship are [here](https://www.oasis-open.org/join-an-open-project/).

-------------------------------------------

**This is a draft proposal.** It has not been submitted to or accepted by OASIS. This charter must be finalized by its proposers and submission
requirements must be met before it can be considered for formation as an official
[OASIS Open Project](http://oasis-open-projects.org). Contact the [Open Projects Administrator](mailto:op-admin@oasis-open.org) for details on this.

**1. Open Project Name**
 Framework for Integrating Application Security into Software Engineering (FIASSE)

**2. Statement of Purpose**
The Framework for Integrating Application Security into Software Engineering (FIASSE) project addresses persistent challenges in application security (AppSec) by championing a developer-centric, principled approach. It recognizes that security is a dynamic, ongoing process—not a static state—and that securable software is an outcome of sound engineering.

To achieve this, FIASSE introduces the Securable Software Engineering Model (SSEM), a common design language that uses established software engineering terms to integrate security seamlessly into the development lifecycle. SSEM empowers developers to build resilient, adaptable, and inherently securable software without requiring them to adopt a specialized security or adversarial mindset.

The project's primary goal is to reduce friction between AppSec and Development teams by aligning security with engineering practices and business objectives. FIASSE provides a durable model for creating securable software, improving the integration of security into modern workflows (including AI-assisted development), and scaling AppSec expertise effectively.

**3. Business Benefits**  
 The FIASSE project will benefit a wide range of stakeholders:

* **Software Engineers** are empowered to build securable software confidently using familiar engineering principles, reducing the cognitive load of specialized security expertise and allowing them to address security as an integral part of their work.
* **Development Teams and Managers** benefit from reduced friction with AppSec teams, more predictable security outcomes, and smoother integration of security into agile and DevOps workflows.
* **Application Security (AppSec) Professionals** gain a scalable framework to align with development practices, collaborate using a shared language, and set clear, actionable security expectations that developers can readily implement.
* **Organizations** can reduce the probability of material impact from cyber events through more inherently securable software, better alignment of security with business objectives, and a sustainable, scalable approach to AppSec.
* **The Open Source Community and Standards Bodies** can leverage FIASSE to improve the security posture of open source projects and to document methods for integrating security into development strategies.

**4. Normative Scope**
 **In Scope:**

* Developing and maintaining the Securable Software Engineering Model (SSEM) specification, defining its core attributes (Maintainability, Trustworthiness, Reliability) and their sub-attributes.
* Creating practical guidance for integrating FIASSE principles throughout the development lifecycle, from requirements and design to implementation (including for AI-assisted development), code review, and dependency management.
* Producing educational materials, such as primers and implementation guides, to help software engineers and AppSec professionals apply FIASSE and SSEM.
* Defining strategies for applying FIASSE to emerging software engineering trends, including AI-driven development, cloud-native architectures, and DevSecOps.
* Providing reference practices for lightweight threat modeling and defensive coding that align with the FIASSE framework.
* Fostering an open, collaborative community to support the evolution of FIASSE.

**Out of Scope:**

* The development of specific software products or security testing tools. FIASSE is a framework and a model, not a tool.
* Mandating specific programming languages, platforms, or development methodologies. FIASSE is designed to be adaptable.
* The creation of a formal certification program for individuals or products.
* The replacement of specialized security expertise. FIASSE is designed to improve collaboration between developers and security experts and to scale security efforts, not to eliminate security roles.

**5. Milestones and Deliverables**
 *Initial milestones and deliverables will include:*

* **Project Foundation:**
  * Establishment of project governance, contribution guidelines, and communication channels.
* **Core Specifications:**
  * Formal publication of the FIASSE framework and SSEM specification, detailing core attributes and integration strategies.
* **Adoption and Educational Resources:**
  * An SSEM Primer to introduce the model and its application.
  * A collection of initial use cases and adoption patterns to illustrate practical benefits.
  * Ongoing development of implementation guides, examples, and other educational materials.

(Plan to work out further milestones and deliverables with the project team.)

**6. Relationship to Other Projects**
 The FIASSE project complements and integrates with existing work in software engineering and application security:

* **OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project):** FIASSE provides a foundational engineering perspective that complements OWASP's assurance-focused resources. While OWASP SAMM and ASVS help measure and verify security, FIASSE provides the "how-to" for building the necessary securable attributes into code and systems from the start.
* **OpenSSF (Open Source Security Foundation):** FIASSE aligns with OpenSSF's goals of improving the security of open source software by providing a framework for developers to create more inherently securable code.
* **ISO/IEC Standards:** SSEM is grounded in internationally recognized terminology, referencing definitions from standards like ISO/IEC 25010 (SQuaRE) and ISO/IEC 27000 to ensure clarity and alignment with established quality and security models.
* **IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force):** In the spirit of RFC 3552 (Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations), FIASSE provides a structured approach for development teams to reason about and build software that implements IETF standards securely.
* **Agile and DevSecOps Practices:** FIASSE is designed to integrate natively into modern development practices, enhancing them with security considerations rather than imposing separate, conflicting processes.

**7. Repositories and Licenses**

**Initial Repositories and Preferred Licenses:**

* Primary Repository: https://github.com/Xcaciv/securable_software_engineering
* Preferred Licence: CC BY 4.0

*(Further repositories may be established as the project evolves.)*

**8. Initial Contributions from Existing Work**  

 The primary initial contribution to this project will be the "Framework for Integrating Application Security into Software Engineering: The Securable Software Engineering Model (SSEM)" document (currently in RFC draft format). This document outlines the foundational principles, core attributes, and integration strategies of SSEM.
