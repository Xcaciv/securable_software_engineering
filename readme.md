## Overview

This repository contains resources and materials for FIASSE (pronounced /feiz/) practices. It focuses on implementing security throughout the software development lifecycle to build resilient applications that protect sensitive data and withstand threats.

## Purpose

To provide practical guidelines that help developers to create secure software without needing years of security experience. Also, to provide practical guidance for security professionals for integrating security into software engineering. All this is done through a strict Software Engineering lense reducing cognitive load on developers.

## Key Principles

- **Software Engineering First**: Prioritizing software engineering practices to ensure security is an integral part of the development process
- **Securable Coding**: Applying comprehensive controls at trust boundaries allowing flexible code to retain value
- **Merge Reviews**: A context for sharing knowledge at scale while improving code
- **Continuous Personal Improvement**: Enabling developers to enhance their knowledge while focusing on software engineering
- **Native Security Extensions**: Complementing software engineering strategies with security tactics without noise
- **Light weight Threat Modelling**: Integrating threat modeling into the development process without adding significant overhead
- **Requiremnts as a first class citizen in AppSec**: the foundation of secure software engineering, ensuring that secure expectations are clearly defined
