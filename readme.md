# Securable Software Engineering

## Overview
This repository contains resources and materials for securable software engineering practices. It focuses on implementing security throughout the software development lifecycle to build resilient applications that protect sensitive data and withstand threats.

## Purpose
To provide practical guidelines, code examples, and tools that help developers integrate security into their software development process from design through implementation and maintenance.

## Key Principles
- **Security by Design**: Building security considerations into applications from the beginning
- **Defense in Depth**: Implementing multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege**: Ensuring components only have access to resources they absolutely need
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Following established patterns to prevent common vulnerabilities
- **Continuous Security Testing**: Regularly assessing applications for security weaknesses

## Repository Contents
- Documentation on secure coding standards
- Code examples demonstrating security implementations
- Tools for security testing and vulnerability scanning
- Implementation guides for common security requirements
- Best practices for secure development workflows

## Getting Started
1. Review the documentation in the `/docs` directory
2. Explore example implementations in the `/examples` folder
3. Try the security testing tools in the `/tools` directory
